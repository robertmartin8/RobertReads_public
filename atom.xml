        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever walked into a room and forgotten why you entered?</p>
<p>I had something to clever to say about this book – at least, I think I did. It was something about memory, or maybe forgetting? But now that I sit down to write, the specifics slip away. Weird.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure there was a secretive government department involved, but I can’t for the life of me remember what they were responsible for. Something about ideas that couldn’t be remembered? I guess that’s plausible enough. Neal Stephenson explores viral ideas – memes – in <a href="/?books=snow-crash" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Snow Crash</a>, so I suppose I can accept the inversion of that concept. We might as well call that an <em>antimeme</em> . Or, for those familiar with <em>Doctor Who</em> , think of the Silence – aliens who fade from memory as soon as they’re out of sight. Funny, my head is starting to hurt. Perhaps I should discuss the writing style instead.</p>
<p>The author shows heaps of raw talent and creativity, reminiscent of PK Dick in both theme and style. There’s the reality distortion of <a href="/?books=ubik" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Ubik</a> and <a href="/?books=a-scanner-darkly" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">A Scanner Darkly</a> , and the unreliable memory from <em>We Can Remember it for You Wholesale</em> . Like with PKD, the prose can be a bit forced, and not all narrative threads are fully resolved. The author wavers between treating antimemes conceptually, like in <em>Snow Crash</em> , or personifying them, like in Doctor Who, mostly leaning towards the latter. This somewhat reduces the intellectual depth of the novel. By personifying antimemes, the author becomes over-reliant on gore and grotesquerie. One sees a similar transition between the early Lovecraft, whose gothic works (<a href="/?books=the-gothic-tales-of-h-p-lovecraft" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Gothic Tales of H. P. Lovecraft</a>) draw heavily on grotesque horror, and the late Lovecraft, for whom terror dwells in the nameless implicit rather than the grotesque explicit. Lovecraft himself had an interesting relationship with memory and forgetfulness, famously haunted by vivid nightmares that inspired his stories but faded quickly on waking. This was probably a case of undiagnosed sleep paralysis, a condition experienced by about 7.6% of the general population, which can occur during the transition between the REM sleep stage and wakefulness as the brain becomes conscious while the muscles remaind paralysed. Wait, why do I feel like I’ve been pushed onto a tangent.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m left with the unsettling sense that I’ve read something important – viscerally new, terrifying, and engaging. A work of genuine talent from a rising author who hopefully has many more books ahead.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Willpower is a finite resource, but it can be strengthened over time.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early in the summer, something strange happened to me. Though I didn’t recognise it at the time, I had lost much of my willpower. This was worrying, as I used to pride myself on having an iron will. I could make myself go to the gym when tired, spend long hours in deep focus, and invest my time with a low discount rate – putting in considerable up-front effort for long-term payoffs. Then, in summer, I noticed that I had become floppy, lazy, and indecisive; the house was always messy, and my task backlog was growing by the day. An unsustainable situation, indeed. This book helped me diagnose what had happened.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently, the concept of willpower was explored more in the realm of poetry and biography than in serious psychological research – another classic case of science shying away from ideas that are hard to define, even when important and deserving of study. Roy Baumeister was among the first psychologists to take willpower seriously, and this book, written with John Tierney, summarises years of his research.</p>
<p>The core thesis is that willpower is very much like a muscle. On any given day, we have a finite amount that gets depleted as we expend it. But over time, through training, we can improve its capacity and durability. Once willpower is drained (technically, once we enter a state of <em>ego depletion</em> ), we struggle to exert ourselves mentally and physically, lose emotional regulation, make impulsive decisions, and crave sweet foods.</p>
<p>This partially explained the “what” of my predicament: by not recognising my reduced willpower, I failed to intervene in the vicious cycle and stopped practising habits that build and maintain willpower. The unwashed dishes and untidy desk were more important than I had realised. A loss of willpower has many ugly downstream consequences: work performance declines, fitness slips, and even social connections suffer as we stop reaching out to friends. But what started this downward spiral? For this, we must turn to the second part of the book’s thesis.</p>
<p>Baumeister found that decision-making heavily depletes willpower resources. This claim seems so intuitive that you might think it obvious. But it’s distinct from the earlier observation that reduced willpower impairs decision-making. There’s a tight, bidirectional relationship that I really don’t think is obvious. In Baumeister’s experiments, participants who made many decisions, even about trivial things like shopping, gave up more easily on a grip strength test (a classic measure of ego depletion). Car salespeople know this phenomenon well: by presenting many options initially, customers become more likely to accept the default option later.</p>
<p>This was the definitive explanation for me. Early summer marked the end of my first six months as a risk-taking trader (“portfolio manager”). The job requires constant decision-making. Every news item, every tick of the chart implicitly demands a choice: should I adjust my positions or do nothing? After long trading days, I would return home utterly spent. Everything felt “purple.” I was more emotional, less willing to make decisions (even about simple things like what to order for dinner), more comfort-seeking, and less resilient to cravings. I stopped maintaining disciplined habits, perpetuating the cycle.</p>
<p>It is true that the book is poorly written. Chapters are long and disorganised; studies are repeated. If it were half as long and included chapter summaries, it could easily merit five stars. But that hardly matters. The two-part recognition – that my willpower had been diminished and that the reduction was due to decision-making – has markedly changed how I approach life. I’ve made it a priority to cultivate disciplined habits, like keeping the house tidy and being much stricter with time allocation. I’ve become more conscious about sugar intake, improved my diet, and created systems at work to reduce the number of decisions I have to make, conserving mental capital. I’ve added barriers to prevent instant dopamine hits from electronic devices (see <a href="/?books=stolen-focus" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Stolen Focus</a> and <a href="/?books=hooked" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Hooked</a> for details on how apps tap into our dopamine circuits). I was particularly inspired by the book’s anecdotes about Henry Morton Stanley, who, in the midst of his disastrous exploration into central Africa to find Livingstone – in which more than half of his men perished – he would find time to shave every day. My simple version of that: every day since finishing the book, I’ve made my bed.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Goal setting:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">One big project at a time, since we only have finite willpower resources.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">People who think more about goals ruminate more and make less progress. Conflicting goals lead to a lot unhappiness!</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Willpower can be strengthened with disciplined habits:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">E.g. students who improved their posture had better outcomes</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Improve discipline by having a clean environment and daily personal cleanliness routines, e.g. Henry Stanley, during the disastrous exploration of central Africa, would shave every day.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Self-esteem vs self-control in children:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Parents should instill self-control rather than self-esteem.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">In experiments where self-esteem is boosted, outcomes (grades) are worse.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Self-esteem does increase initiative, and it provides a bank of positive emotions which can help in difficult times.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Success causes self-esteem rather than vice versa</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Broad increases in narcissism may be related to the self-esteem movement.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dieting:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dieting generally counterproductive. When people fail to meet their target, they say “what the hell” and eat in excess.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Sweet food particularly hard to resist because self-control depletes glucose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Specific tips on diet:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Postpone pleasure. Tell yourself you can have it later. This satisfies the craving somewhat. If craving sugar, eat something with low GI first. This helps repopulate the glucose</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Keep unhealthy food out of sight, so that you don’t need to expend willpower to avoid it.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Simple precommitments: e.g. brushing teeth earlier.</li>

<p>willpower, like a muscle, becomes fatigued from overuse but can also be strengthened over the long term through exercise. (loc 80)</p>

<p>people with good self-control mainly use it not for rescue in emergencies but rather to develop effective habits and routines in school and at work. The results of these habits and routines were demonstrated in yet another recent set of studies, in the United States, showing that people with high self-control consistently report less stress in their lives. They use their self-control not to get through crises but to avoid them. (loc 3464)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Your supply of willpower is limited, and you use the same resource for many different things. (loc 3530)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Virtually no one has a gut-level sense of just how tiring it is to decide. Choosing what to have for dinner, where to go on vacation, whom to hire, how much to spend—these all take willpower. Even hypothetical decisions deplete energy. After making some tough decisions, remember that your self-control is going to be weakened. Remember, too, that what matters is the exertion, not the outcome. If you struggle with temptation and then give in, you’re still depleted because you struggled. (loc 3540)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When you’re budgeting your time, don’t give drudgery more than its necessary share. Remember Parkinson’s Law: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Set a firm time limit for tedious tasks. “Clean out basement” or “Reorganize closets” could take up the whole day—if you ever got around to it, which you won’t because you don’t want to lose a day of your life to something so mundane. But if you set a clear limit of one or two hours, you might get something done this Saturday (loc 3600)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Another simple old-fashioned way to boost your willpower is to expend a little of it on neatness. As we described in chapter 7, people exert less self-control after seeing a messy desk than after seeing a clean desk, or when using a sloppy rather than a neat and wellorganized Web site. You may not care about whether your bed is made and your desk is clean, but these environmental cues subtly influence your brain and your behavior, making it ultimately less of a strain to maintain self-discipline. (loc 3651)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Procrastination is usually a vice, but occasionally—very occasionally—there is such a thing as positive procrastination. In the previous chapter we discussed experiments showing that people tempted by chocolate managed to avoid it by telling themselves they’d eat it some other time—a postponement strategy that worked better than trying to deny themselves altogether. This “I’ll have it later” trick can work for other temptations, too. If a TV show is keeping you from getting back to work, record it and tell yourself you’ll finish watching it later. (loc 3661)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Monitoring is crucial for any kind of plan you make—and it can even work if you don’t make a plan at all. (loc 3707)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When you set a goal, set a reward for reaching it—and then don’t stiff yourself. If you just use willpower to deny yourself things, it becomes a grim, thankless form of defense. But when you use it to gain something, you can wring pleasure out of the dreariest tasks. (loc 3721)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>Freud, who theorized that the self depended on mental activities involving the transfer of energy. But Freud’s energy model of the self was generally ignored by subsequent researchers. (loc 135)</p>

<p>“ego depletion,” Baumeister’s term for describing people’s diminished capacity to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and actions. People can sometimes overcome mental fatigue, but Baumeister found that if they had used up energy by exerting willpower (or by making decisions, another form of ego depletion that we’ll discuss later), they would eventually succumb. […]</p>
<p>while depleted persons (once again) didn’t show any single telltale emotion, they did react more strongly to all kinds of things. A sad movie made them extra sad. Joyous pictures made them happier, and disturbing pictures made them more frightened and upset. Ice-cold water felt more painful to them than it did to people who were not ego-depleted. Desires intensified along with feelings. (loc 479)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>ego depletion causes a slowdown in the anterior cingulate cortex, the brain area that’s crucial to self-control. As the brain slows down and its error-detection ability deteriorates, people have trouble controlling their reactions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There’s no obvious “feeling” of depletion. Hence you need to watch yourself for subtle, easily misinterpreted signs. Do things seem to bother you more than they should? Has the volume somehow been turned up on your life so that things are felt more strongly than usual? Is it suddenly hard to make up your mind about even simple things? Are you more than usually reluctant to make a decision or exert yourself mentally or physically? If you notice such feelings, then reflect on the last few hours and see if it seems likely that you have depleted your willpower. If so, try to conserve what’s left while anticipating the effects on your behavior. (loc 3550)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Closing a door on an option is experienced as a loss, and people are willing to pay a price to avoid the emotion of loss,” Ariely says. Sometimes that makes sense, but too often we’re so eager to keep options open that we don’t see the long-term price that we’re paying—or that others are paying. When you won’t settle for less than a perfect mate, you end up with no one. (loc 1491)</p>
<p><em>Decision making is stressful</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When your willpower is low, you’re less able to make these trade-offs. You become what researchers call a “cognitive miser,” hoarding your energy by avoiding compromises. You’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: Just give me the cheapest. (loc 1504)</p>

<p>When a psychiatrist testifying for the defense cited White’s consumption of Twinkies and other junk food in the days before the murders, journalists mocked White for trying to excuse himself with a “Twinkie defense.” In fact, White’s chief defense wasn’t based on the argument that the Twinkies turned him murderous by causing his blood-sugar levels to quickly spike and then crash. His attorneys argued that he deserved mercy because he suffered from “diminished capacity” due to severe depression, and they presented his junk-food consumption (along with other changes in habits) as evidence of his depression, (loc 681)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One study found below-average glucose levels in 90 percent of the juvenile delinquents recently taken into custody. Other studies reported that people with hypoglycemia were more likely to be convicted of a wide variety of offenses: traffic violations, public profanity, shoplifting, destruction of property, exhibitionism, public masturbation, embezzlement, arson, spouse abuse, and child abuse. (loc 688)</p>

<p>The effects of the drinks showed up clearly in a study of aggression among people playing a computer game. At first, the game seemed reasonable, but it soon became impossibly difficult. Everyone got frustrated as the game went on, but the one who got a sugar-filled drink managed to grumble quietly and keep playing. The others started cursing aloud and banging the computer. (loc 736)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As the body uses glucose during self-control, it starts to crave sweet things to eat—which is bad news for people hoping to use their self-control to avoid sweets. When people have more demands for self-control in their daily lives, their hunger for sweets increases. It’s not a simple matter of wanting all food more—they seem to be specifically hungry for sweets. In the lab, students who have just performed a self-control task eat more sweet snacks but not other (salty) snacks. (loc 771)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>PMS, like hypoglycemia and diabetes, makes a conveniently clear-cut example of what happens when the body is short of glucose—and everyone, male or female, diabetic or nondiabetic, runs low on glucose at times (loc 851)</p>

<p>To maintain steady self-control, you’re better off eating foods with a low glycemic index: most vegetables, nuts (like peanuts and cashews), many raw fruits (like apples, blueberries, and pears), cheese, fish, meat, olive oil, and other “good” fats. (loc 885)</p>

<p>Focus on one project at a time.

<p>It might seem that people who think more about their goals would also take more steps to reach them, but instead they replace action with rumination. The researchers found that people with clear, unconflicting goals tended to forge ahead and make progress, but the rest were so busy worrying that they got stuck. (loc 996)</p>

<p>people with conflicting goals reported fewer positive emotions, more negative emotions, and more depression and anxiety. They had more psychosomatic complaints and symptoms. Even just plain physical sickness, measured both by the number of visits to the doctor and by the number of self-reported illnesses over the course of a year, was higher among the people with conflicting goals. The more the goals conflicted, the more the people got stuck, and the more unhappy and unhealthy they became. (loc 999)</p>

<p>The group with the proximal goals outperformed everyone else when the program was over and competence was tested. They succeeded, apparently, because meeting these daily goals gradually built their confidence and self-efficacy. With their focus on a specific goal for each session, they learned better and faster than the others. (loc 1041)</p>

<p>The monthly planning group did the best, in terms of improvements in study habits and attitudes. Among the weaker students (though not among the good ones), monthly planning led to much bigger improvements in grades than did the daily planning. Monthly planners also kept it up much longer than the daily planners, and the continued planning thus was more likely to carry over into their work after the program ended. (loc 1067)</p>

<p>Those who’d written about unfulfilled tasks had more trouble keeping their minds focused on the novel—unless they’d made a specific plan to complete the task, in which case they reported relatively little mind wandering and scored quite well on the reading comprehension test. Even though they hadn’t finished the task or made any palpable progress, the simple act of making a plan had cleared their minds and eliminated the Zeigarnik effect. (loc 1230)</p>

<p>By overriding their habit of slouching, the students strengthened their willpower and did better at tasks that had nothing to do with posture.

<p>But as of this morning, you’re not dead yet. There’s no food in camp, but at least you’re alive. Now that you’ve arisen and taken care of nature’s first call of the morning, what’s the next thing to do? For Stanley, this was an easy decision: shave. As one of his servants in England would later recall: “He had often told me that, on his various expeditions, he had made it a rule, always to shave carefully. In the Great Forest, in ‘Starvation Camp,’ on the mornings of battle, he had never neglected this custom, however great the difficulty; he told me he had often shaved with cold water, or with blunt razors.” (loc 2250)</p>

<p>Stanley’s belief in the link between external order and inner self-discipline has been confirmed recently in some remarkable studies. In one experiment, a group of participants answered questions sitting in a nice neat laboratory room, while others sat in the kind of place that inspires parents to shout, “Clean up your room!” The people in the messy room scored lower in self-control on many measures, such as being unwilling to wait a week for a larger sum of money as opposed to taking a smaller sum right away.

<p>The page-a-day folks had done well and generally gotten tenure. The so-called “binge writers” fared far less well, and many had had their careers cut short. The clear implication was that the best advice for young writers and aspiring professors is: Write every day.

<p>Religious people are less likely than others to develop unhealthy habits, like getting drunk, engaging in risky sex, taking illicit drugs, and smoking cigarettes. They’re more likely to wear seat belts, visit a dentist, and take vitamins. They have better social support, and their faith helps them cope psychologically with misfortunes. And they have better self-control, (loc 2594)</p>

<p>The strongest evidence yet was published in 2010. In a painstaking long-term study, much larger and more thorough than anything done previously, an international team of researchers tracked one thousand children in New Zealand from birth until the age of thirty-two. Each child’s self-control was rated in a variety of ways (through observations by researchers as well as in reports of problems from parents, teachers, and the children themselves). This produced an especially reliable measure of children’s self-control, and the researchers were able to check it against an extraordinarily wide array of outcomes through adolescence and into adulthood. The children with high self-control grew up into adults who had better physical health, including lower rates of obesity, fewer sexually transmitted diseases, and even healthier teeth. (Apparently, good self-control includes brushing and flossing.) (loc 236)</p>

<p>Yes, students with higher self-esteem did have higher grades. But which came first? Did students’ self-esteem lead to good grades, or did good grades lead to self-esteem? It turned out that grades in tenth grade predicted self-esteem in twelfth grade, but self-esteem in tenth grade failed to predict grades in twelfth grade. Thus, it seemed, the grades came first, and the self-esteem came afterward. (loc 2757)</p>

<p>In another carefully controlled study, Donald Forsyth tried boosting the self-esteem of some of the students in his psychology class at Virginia Commonwealth University. He randomly assigned some students who got a C grade or worse on the midterm to receive a weekly message boosting their self-esteem, and some students with similar grades to get a neutral weekly message. The weekly pep talks presumably helped the students feel better about themselves, but it didn’t help their grades—quite to the contrary. When they took the final exam, not only did they do worse than the control group but their grades were even lower than what they’d gotten on the midterm. Their average score dropped from 59 to 39—from borderline passing down to hopeless. (loc 2759)</p>

<p>There seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem, according to the review panel. First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.) Second, it feels good. High self-esteem seems to operate like a bank of positive emotions, which furnish a general sense of well-being and can be useful when you need an extra dose of confidence to cope with misfortune, (loc 2782)</p>

<p>Narcissists are legends in their own mind and addicted to their grandiose images. They have a deep craving to be admired by other people (but don’t feel a special need to be liked—it’s adulation they require). They expect to be treated as special beings and will turn nasty when criticized. They tend to make very good first impressions but don’t wear well. When the psychologist Delroy Paulhus asked people in groups to rate one another, the narcissists seemed to be everyone’s favorite person, but only during the first few meetings. After a few months, they usually slipped to the bottom of the rankings. (loc 2790)</p>

<p>This broad rise in narcissism is the problem child of the self-esteem movement, and it is not likely to change anytime soon, because the movement persists despite the evidence that it’s not making children become more successful, honest, or otherwise better citizens. (loc 2801)</p>

<p>There’s one notable exception to the trend toward narcissism observed in psychological studies of young Americans. It doesn’t appear among young Asian-Americans, probably because their parents have been influenced less by the self-esteem movement than by a cultural tradition of instilling discipline. […]</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing IQ studies, Flynn concludes that the scores of Chinese-American and Japanese-American people are very similar to whites of European descent. If anything, the Asian-Americans’ IQ is slightly lower, on average, although they do show up more at both the upper and lower extremes. The big difference is that they make better use of their intelligence. (loc 2822)</p>

<p>there are three basic facets of punishment: severity, speed, and consistency. Many people associate strict discipline with severe penalties, but that’s actually the least important facet. Researchers have found that severity seems to matter remarkably little and can even be counterproductive: Instead of encouraging virtue, harsh punishments teach the child that life is cruel and that aggression is appropriate.

<p>Besides resenting the unfairness, you learn that the most important thing is not how you behave but whether or not you get caught, and whether your parents are in the mood to punish.

<p>The researchers gave it a formal scientific term, counterregulatory eating, but in their lab and among colleagues it was known simply as the what-the-hell effect. Dieters have a fixed target in mind for their maximum daily calories, and when they exceed it for some unexpected reason, such as being given a pair of large milkshakes in an experiment, they regard their diet as blown for the day.

<p>Humans are born with an innate gift for eating just the right amount. When an infant’s body needs food, it sends a signal through hunger pangs. When the body has had enough food, the infant doesn’t want to eat any more. Unfortunately, children start to lose this ability by the time they enter school, and it continues to decline later in life (loc 3223)</p>

<p>The researchers found that there was no connection between the women’s moods and their eating: The ones who were sadder after the movie didn’t eat extra ice cream to drown their sorrows. What mattered was not their mood but rather their will. The dieters who had suppressed emotions during the movie had a much harder time suppressing their appetite. (loc 3255)</p>

<p>Sweet food becomes especially hard to resist because, as we’ve already seen, self-control depletes the glucose in the bloodstream. If you’ve ever been on a diet and found yourself unable to shake those intrusive cravings for chocolate or ice cream, this is more than a matter of repressed desires coming back to haunt you. There is a sound physiological basis. (loc 3282)</p>

<p>The shift in people’s characters was noticed by a psychoanalyst named Allen Wheelis, who in the late 1950s revealed what he considered a dirty little secret of his profession: Freudian therapies no longer worked the way they were supposed to. In his landmark book, The Quest for Identity, Wheelis described a change in character structure since Freud’s day. The Victorian middle-class citizens who formed the bulk of Freud’s patients had intensely strong wills, making it difficult for therapists to break through their ironclad defenses and their sense of what was right and wrong. Freud’s therapies had concentrated on ways to break through and let them see why they were neurotic and miserable, because once those people achieved insight, they could change rather easily.

<p>Men who saw photos of hot women shifted toward getting an immediate reward instead of waiting for a larger payoff in the future.

This effect is probably deeply rooted in the psyche and in the evolutionary past. […]</p>
<p>the sight of an attractive woman (but not an unattractive woman) activates the male brain’s nucleus accumbens, which is connected to the part of the brain activated by rewards like cash and sweet-tasting foods.

He expected worse hardships ahead, but he didn’t focus on them in the last letter he would be able to dispatch until reaching the other side of Africa. “My love towards you is unchanged, you are my dream, my stay, my hope, and my beacon,” he wrote to her. “I shall cherish you in this light until I meet you, or death meets me.” Stanley clung to that hope for another thirty-five hundred miles, taking the Lady Alice down the Congo River, surviving attacks from cannibals chanting a war cry of “Niama!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“No man ever steps through the same river twice” (Heraclitus). Unless you don’t know there’s a river! <em>Waiting for Godot</em> is a play where nothing happens – twice – but only on the second iteration do you realise that you are surrounded by whirling currents.</p>
<p>One year ago, almost to the day, I read <a href="/?books=invisible-cities" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Invisible Cities</a> by Calvino, which to me was “deconstruction that eschews deconstructionism”. <em>Waiting for Godot</em> has a similar feel, but there is no construction to be deconstructed. Instead, it is a rapidfire, subtle, staccato blend of comic absurdity with bleak existential rumination, bridging Carroll and Camus.</p>
<p>A younger version of me would have been frustrated and tantalised by the lack of clear meaning. In fact, the only &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; is the importance of companionship – amidst all the frustration, confusion, and pain, there is a heartening warmth in the relationship between Vladimir and Estragon. I would have doubtless constructed some theory to understand the play – perhaps treating Godot as an allegory for God, or seeing Pozzo and Lucky as representing master-slave dialectics.</p>
<p>But the sheer number of possible interpretations hints at something more abstract. <em>Waiting for Godot</em> is not a puzzle to be solved, but a canvas onto which meaning is projected. Ironically, this offers one possible solution to the very problem the play explores – how we find meaning in an uncaring universe. The play itself becomes both the canvas and the brush. Sisyphus is made happy by projecting meaning onto his toil, and imagining himself happy.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rules-of-thumb to survive as an options dealer]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Dynamic Hedging</em> is a book about defense, not offense. Here’s the scenario: you’ve just been handed a massive steaming pile of derivatives, and your task is simple – survive!</p>
<p>This is precisely the position of market makers. Their role is to sell options to buyers, buy options from whoever wants to sell them, and try to clip some edge without blowing up. This is a tough seat. Even with simple linear instruments like equities, counterparties typically trade with you when they have a view, so adverse selection is a constant worry. As an options market maker, you must also contend with the inherent complexities and nonlinearities of the instruments.</p>
<p>Taleb, as far as we know, was rather good at this, and <em>Dynamic Hedging</em> distills the wisdom that he gained from his time in the trenches. This wisdom primarily comprises practical rules-of-thumb and empirical techniques focused on risk management – a guide to navigating the countless ways you can lose money trading options.</p>
<p>Yes, in places it feels dated, which is understandable for a book written in 1997. Modern textbooks offer more precise and rigorous explanations of volatility smiles and term structure, largely because we culturally have a much better understanding of how to use the Black-Scholes-Merton model – as a change of variables rather than a prescriptive valuation formula.</p>
<p>But the book’s intuitive approach allows you to survive even in the absence of sophisticated theory. This becomes particularly crucial when dealing with complex exotics, where “modern” analytic methods may struggle due to both limitations of the theoretical machinery, and a lack of knowledge from the trader. In this light, while the book may be old-fashioned, it remains highly relevant, serving as a comprehensive guide to avoiding financial catastrophe.</p>

But it’s hard to stay too optimistic in the face of a tragic double suicide – especially when one of the victims happens to be a key figure in a political conspiracy… I’ll say no more.</p>
<p>The writing is engaging without being flowery, with Matsumoto expertly managing the tempo as we navigate a complex plot. The <em>presto</em> of zipping through different parts of Japan by rail contrasts pleasantly with the <em>andante</em> of meandering through a quiet seaside town, or sitting in a warm Tokyo cafe, as the detective contemplates the case. Unfortunately, the novel is let down by its exposition: the entire denouement unfolds, rather anticlimactically, through a letter from the detective to a colleague. There’s no dramatic revelation where the murderer is caught red-handed, nor a triumphant, witty soliloquy from a Poirot or Holmes. On this basis, If I were a rigorous literary critic, I would have to give <em>Tokyo Express</em> three stars.</p>
<p>Thankfully, one of the joys of being an amateur book reviewer is freedom from such constraints. What can I say, the book just has a certain charm. It transported me to the heart of the Tokyo Railway station in Chiyoda (which I was lucky enough to visit on a family holiday in November 2017), surrounded by busy salarymen rushing for their commuter trains as sleek Shinkansen glide in and out. If you’ve ever found yourself mesmerised by train schedules, or delighted in cutting things very fine in order to squeeze the most out of your travel, <em>Tokyo Express</em> is irresistible.</p>

<p>He recognized a few regulars. The place hadn&#39;t changed in the slightest while he was away. For the waitress and customers alike, life at the cafe had been carrying on as usual. On the other side of the window; the streets of Ginza seemed unchanged, too. It was as though, for the five or six days he&#39;d been away, he alone had beer thrust from this world. Nobody here knew what Mihara had been up to during the intervening days - and, despite the unusual things he had seen, nobody showed even a passing interest in him. Of course, this was only natural, and yet it left him feeling strangely lonely (p. 53)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If only it were as easy as “justified true belief”]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>What is This Thing Called Knowledge?</em> is Duncan Pritchard’s courageous attempt at introducing all of epistemology – the theory of knowledge – in a relatively brief text. It centres around the titular question: what on Earth is knowledge?</p>
<p>The classical tripartite account – that knowledge is justified true belief – is an acceptable starting point, but it quickly runs into problems. Consider Agrippa’s trilemma regarding the justification of knowledge: either our knowledge is unjustified, circularly justified, or justified by an infinite chain. With some work, we find that these are somewhat tenable, so perhaps the classical account is onto something. But then, in 1963, the young philosopher Edmund Gettier published a devastating three-page article that all but killed the classical understanding and sparked a renaissance in epistemology. Amusingly, Gettier thereafter showed little interest in epistemology, and never again published in the field.</p>
<p>Gettier cases are situations in which, by coincidence, your reasoning leads to a belief that happens to be true. For example, you see the time on your watch is 9am, and it indeed happens to be 9am, but your watch was actually broken. Here, you have a justified true belief of the time that is clearly not knowledge. A quick fix might be to redefine knowledge to be justified true belief <em>gained reliably</em> , which addresses the broken watch example, but this is still vulnerable to Gettier-style attacks. There’s the amusing case of a farmer seeing a sheep in the field, but instead of a sheep, it is someone wearing a sheep costume, behind whom there is a real sheep. The farmer has justified true belief that there is a sheep in the field, formed reliably, but it’s not clear that we can call this knowledge either.</p>
<p>One of the modern resolutions is virtue epistemology, which despite its apparent fluffiness, I eventually found quite compelling. Virtue epistemology shifts the focus to the agents forming the beliefs. For a true belief to become knowledge, the belief must be true due to intellectual virtues of the agent, rather than just luck. Sosa summarises knowledge thus: the belief must be true (accurate), formed competently through intellectual virtues (adroit), and true because of the agent’s competence (apt). Building from this slightly more solid footing, Pritchard explores several “areas of knowledge”, for example, scientific and religious knowledge.</p>
<p>One key area not addressed by Pritchard is probabilistic knowledge. Perhaps I am biased by my day job as a trader, but the fact that the world is full of aleatory uncertainty (let alone the epistemic variety) is a fairly pertinent issue. But it’s not clear how to proceed – even the most basic concept of “true belief” is not trivially applied to probabilistic statements. It strikes me that virtue epistemology is one approach: by making use of cognitive faculties (like being a good Bayesian updater), we can strive to maximise the correlation between our beliefs and reality.</p>
<p>I can’t finish this review without mentioning Frank Ramsey, that great polymath who died at 26 and remains salient in my mind after reading Cheryl Misak’s biography (<a href="/?books=frank-ramsey-a-sheer-excess-of-powers" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Frank Ramsey: a Sheer Excess of Powers</a>) earlier this year. Ramsey, whose name unfortunately does not once feature in Pritchard’s book, was concerned with the deep ideas underlying epistemology – the nature of justification, truth, and belief – rather than taking those as a given and defining knowledge therewith. Had he not died at 26, I like to think that he might have completed the manuscript <em>On Truth</em>, and eventually linked it with his distinct pragmatic philosophy and deep knowledge of the philosophy of probability to produce a practical Bayesian epistemology. With Ramsey in mind, my answer to the question <em>what is this thing called knowledge</em>: knowledge is that which helps us make better decisions that guide us on the road to eudaimonia.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">What is Knowledge: start with Justified True Belief.<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Epistemology is concerned with propositional knowledge rather than ability knowledge (e.g. knowing how to swim)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Most epistemologists agree that a necessary condition is true belief</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Assume that truth is objective: belief in something does not make it true</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Rationality: related to epistemology but not the same<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Epistemic rationality is aimed at forming true beliefs, as opposed to a more general rationality which sometimes suggests that you should delude yourself if it increases utility.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Deontic epistemic rationality: someone is rational if they are following their own epistemic norms (decision processes) well. Non-deontic epistemic rationality also requires that these epistemic norms be correct.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Demotic epistemic rationality is a form of Epistemic internalism. Epistemic internalists hold that knowledge is due to internal processes. Epistemic externalists: whether or not you have knowledge depends on external factors, like whether you were raised with the correct epistemic norms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Classical ideas in epistemology:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The problem of the criterion: you can only identify knowledge if you have criteria; you can only have criteria if you can identify instances of knowledge.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Agrippa’s trilemma: either our beliefs are ultimately unjustified, they are justified by an infinite chain, or they are circular. Three main resolutions:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Infinitism: infinite chain can justify belief</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Coherentism (Quine): circular justification is valid</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Classical foundationalism (Descartes): knowledge is a chain of justifications that terminates on self-justifying foundational beliefs.</li>

</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Modern accounts of epistemology:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The classical/tripartite account of knowledge – justified true belief – suffers from Gettier cases (1963), where you have a justified true belief due to luck (seeing a broken clock that is coincidentally showing the right time). No easy solution.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Reliabilism: knowledge is justified true belief that has been gained reliably. Still suffers from Gettier cases, for example the dog in the sheep costume, behind which there is a sheep.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Virtue epistemology: knowledge is true belief gained by one’s epistemic virtues or reliable cognitive faculties. This is an epistemic internalist belief; would not consider chicken-sexers to have knowledge (they can reliably identify chickenpox sex but have false ideas about how they do it).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Sosa’s virtue epistemology has three criteria:<ol>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Accuracy: The belief is true.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Adroitness: The belief is formed competently through intellectual virtues.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Abduction: generate the best explanation of a single phenomenon (what Sherlock does). Induction is a generalisation of Abduction.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Popper uses falsificationism to escape the problem of induction. Start by making a hypothesis: all swans are white, then if you find a black swan you can deductively know that not all swans are white.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Reichenbach gives the pragmatic argument that without induction, we won’t have many true beliefs.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Kuhn’s scientific revolutions:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Science proceeds in revolutionary paradigm shifts</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Early Kuhn believed that the new paradigm is not just a new set of concepts, but a completely different truth-seeking process, with different standards for relevant evidence.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">In this framing, scientific knowledge is not “accumulating” – each new paradigm completely reinterprets (or discards) the old.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Kuhn moderated on this later in life.</li>

<p><strong>Religious and moral knowledge</strong></p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Classical attempts at justifying religion rationally:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Ontological argument: God is definitionally the greatest thing to exist. If God didn’t exist, then one could conceive of a greater being, with the same attributes as God but which existed. This leads to a contradiction, so God must exist.

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Fideism: religion is outside of the scope of epistemic requirements</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Reformed epistemology (Alvin Plantinga):<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">For other types of knowledge (e.g. that gained by perception), we don’t require independent evidence. Hence we should maybe allow for a religious believer’s <em>sensus divinatus.</em></li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Challenges: unlike perception, not everyone has this <em>sensus divinatus</em> . Also, reformed epistemology allows for Flying Spaghetti Monster.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Key epistemological questions in various fields:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Education: goal of education is the development of epistemological virtues.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Legal: higher standard of evidence required because of the social cost of being wrong.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Politics: fake news, like bad science, is not just news (science) done poorly. It is epistemically different as it is designed to mislead.

</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Ignorance: just because we do not know something (e.g. in Gettier cases) does not make us ignorant. We can treat ignorance as a lack of knowledge in the Virtue Epistemology sense.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Hermeneutical injustice: existing social structures prevent someone from identifying their current situation. E.g. “sexual harassment” as a concept was only developed in the 1970s</li>

<p>The view which denies that there is an external world in this sense – that is, which denies that there is a world that is independent of our experience of it – is known as idealism (loc 1706)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Kant agrees with the simple idealist that what we are immediately aware of in sensory experience is not the world itself. Nevertheless, unlike the idealist, he argues that we are required to suppose that there is an external world that gives rise to this sensory experience since, without this supposition, we would not be able to make any sense of such experience. (loc 1736)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We began by noting a distinction between a priori knowledge and empirical knowledge. The former is knowledge that you have gained without having to investigate the world (i.e. armchair knowledge), while the latter is gained, at least in part, via a worldly investigation. An important kind of a priori knowledge is gained by introspection, which is where we ‘look inwardly’ and examine our own psychological states rather than ‘look outwardly’ and investigate the world. As we saw, however, not all introspective knowledge is a priori knowledge. (loc 2237)</p>

<p>judgement passed down by one Judge William Overton in 1982, in a famous ruling known as McLean versus the Arkansas Board of Education. The background to the case was that it had been decreed that creationism should be taught in publicly funded schools in Arkansas alongside evolutionary theory as an alternative scientific account of our origins.</p>
<p>The court case was brought by those unhappy with this development, who argued that creationism is not a scientific proposal but merely the expression of a certain religious view, and hence had no place being taught in a US publicly funded school (since the US constitution forbids the advocacy of religion in publicly funded schools). After hearing the testimony of various parties, including the testimony of several influential philosophers of science, Judge Overton was called upon to give a ruling in this case. (loc 2565)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>is bad science thereby pseudo-science? This is a deep point, in that while there is clearly a difference to be drawn between bad science and pseudo-science, the distinction is far from sharp. Indeed, once we acknowledge that genuine science can be done badly, then this raises the question of why we should exclude creationism from the canon of genuine science at all. Why not instead regard it merely as genuine science done in a sub-optimal way (i.e. as bad science, rather than pseudo-science)? (loc 2641)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Kuhn argues for the incommensurability of the new revolutionary scientific theory and the old scientific theory it is replacing. That is, the former is not an adaption of the latter as the ‘incremental’ view of scientific progress suggests, but rather a radical new way of scientific theorising which has nothing that is clearly in common with the old view. As a result, it is difficult, if not impossible, to compare the two scientific paradigms side by side, since they each constitute radically different ways of scientific theorising, not only in terms of how they respond to the scientific evidence but also in terms of what they take the relevant scientific evidence to be in the first place. (loc 2718)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it calls into question the very idea of scientific progress as the accumulation of scientific knowledge. Notice that if scientific revolutions incorporate such radical theoretical change, then the new scientific knowledge that accrues after the scientific revolution can hardly be thought to be incorporating the body of scientific knowledge constituted by the old scientific theory. (loc 2723)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>in the Kuhnian picture, the old scientific paradigm may well be very adept at accommodating the empirical evidence, and relative to this paradigm there may well be no definitive empirical counter-evidence which is fatal to the view. Of course, the new scientific paradigm may have a conception of the scientific evidence on which the old scientific paradigm is refuted, but a paradigm-relative falsification of a theory is quite different from the kind of falsification that Judge Overton had in mind, (loc 2734)</p>

<p>imagine that one were confronted by someone sceptical about the possibility of perceptual knowledge. Could one offer adequate evidence in support of one’s perceptual beliefs that is independent in this way (i.e. which even the sceptic about perceptual knowledge would grant as being good evidence)? Clearly, the natural evidence that one might offer in this regard (i.e. the evidence of one’s senses) is disallowed, since this is evidence that is gained via perception itself, the putative source of knowledge which is being called into question.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Reformed epistemologists claim that if we can make sense of how our innate sensory faculties can, in the right conditions, lead us to rationally held perceptual belief and perceptual knowledge, then we ought to be able to make sense of how a corresponding story can be told about religious belief, such that the believer’s innate religious faculty – her sensus divinitatis – can in the right conditions lead her to rationally held religious belief and (if the beliefs so formed are true) religious knowledge.

<p>If one holds that there are no moral facts, then one is endorsing moral expressivism.

<p>disagreements can prevent us from having knowledge that we might have otherwise possessed. After all, not everyone’s opinion is on a par, and so insofar as we do take disagreements seriously, then we might be in danger of losing knowledge (loc 3508)</p>

<p>Another way that disagreement can destroy genuine knowledge is by being a defeater for that knowledge.

Notice too that the defeater will undermine your knowledge even if you continue to believe that Riga is the capital of Latvia. (loc 3534)</p>

<p>Fricker argues that epistemic injustice comes in two forms: hermeneutical injustice and testimonial injustice.

<p>Touching the Void is a famous documentary made in 2003. It is a dramatic retelling of a real-life incident involving two mountain climbers who face disaster after one of them has an accident on the mountain Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. One of the most spectacular scenes in the film concerns the moment when the main protagonist has to make a choice between certain death and the unknown. He has fallen deep into the heart of a glacier and is now hanging there in the darkness unable, due to his injuries, to climb out. The choice he is faced with is either to hang there in the darkness until he eventually passes out and dies, or else cut the rope and let himself fall deeper into the darkness of the glacier below him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wildly creative hard-scifi with a focus on AI and space exploration]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greg Egan is one of those authors who is little known outside his genre (hard sci-fi) and perhaps inscrutable to lay readers, but unforgettable for true fans. <em>Oceanic</em> is a compelling collection that fully justifies Egan’s reputation as the “hardest” hard sci-fi author. Rather than simply stating that “an interstellar probe was sent”, Egan dives into the plausible-yet-fictional physics behind the probe, often in excessive detail.</p>
<p>In another Egan anthology, <a href="/?books=axiomatic" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Axiomatic</a>, the core themes are mind-body dualism and simulated consciousness. <em>Oceanic</em> relegates these concepts to the background – as if digital copies of consciousness are already commonplace – allowing Egan to focus more thematically on AI safety and space travel. It’s a well-constructed collection with a cohesive “cinematic universe,” though each story stands on its own. For example, the synthetic human Helen from <em>Singleton</em> reappears in <em>Oracle</em> , explaining how humanity ends up in synthetic bodies. <em>Induction</em> chronicles Earth’s galactic expansion through “spores” that land in new solar systems and use nanomachines to build infrastructure, ready to receive beamed consciousnesses and load them into new bodies. The story’s title hints at Egan’s suggestion that once this is achieved for one planet, it will soon spread across the galaxy by induction. This groundwork builds toward <em>Riding the Crocodile</em> , <em>Glory</em> , and <em>Hot Rock</em> , which feature a post-scarcity galactic society called the Amalgam. Here, inhabitants can choose to live as digital consciousnesses or inhabit synthetic bodies, freely exploring worlds as they please.</p>
<p>Having said that, the best story in the collection is the standalone <em>Dark Integers</em> . This is Egan at his most creative. Mathematics itself obeys Einstein locality, allowing different parts of the universe to have different mathematical truth. Aliens are involved. It’s wacky, mind-bending, and Hofstadter-coded, and pushes the boundaries of conceptual sci-fi. The same can be said of Egan more generally. But it’s not for the faint of heart!</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the far side were as peaceable as anyone might reasonably wish their neighbors to be, but if their mathematical infrastructure came under threat they faced the real prospect of annihilation. They had defended themselves from such a threat once before, but because they had been able to trace it to its source and understand its nature, they had shown great forbearance. They had not struck their assailants dead, or wiped out Shanghai, or pulled the ground out from under our universe. (loc 633)</p>

<p>“What you and Dr. Tierney suggested was that random processes in the early universe might have included proofs of mutually contradictory theorems about the integers, the idea being that no computation to expose the inconsistency had yet had time to occur. Is that a fair summary?” (loc 764)</p>

<p>A “proof” concerning the integers was just a class of physical processes, and the result of that proof was neither read from, nor written to, any universal book of truths. Rather, the agreement between proofs was simply a strong, but imperfect, correlation between the different processes that counted as proofs of the same thing. Those correlations arose from the way that the primordial states of Planck-scale physics were carved up – imperfectly – into subsystems that appeared to be distinct objects. The truths of mathematics appeared to be enduring and universal because they persisted with great efficiency within the states of matter and space-time. (loc 1077)</p>

<p>“We need the Phites themselves to act as translators,” he told Lucien. “We need to contrive a situation where there’s a large enough pool who choose not to be boosted that the old language continues to be used.” “So we need maybe twenty-five per cent refusing the boost?” Lucien suggested. “And we need the boosted Phites to want to keep them informed of what’s happening, in terms that we can all understand.” (loc 1800)</p>

<p>seems to me that you were ill-prepared for the task you set yourself. If you’d waited for the machine you really needed, our lives would not have been so hard. And if such a machine could not be built in your lifetime, what was to stop your grandchildren from taking on that task?” “I had no choice,” Daniel insisted. “I couldn’t leave your creation to my descendants.

<p>It seemed the Phites had discovered the Higgs field, and engineered a burst of something akin to cosmic inflation. What they’d done wasn’t as simple as merely inflating a tiny patch of vacuum into a new universe, though. Not only had they managed to create a “cool Big Bang”, they had pulled a large chunk of ordinary matter into the pocket universe they’d made, after which the wormhole leading to it had shrunk to subatomic size and fallen through the Earth.

<p>Steve Hasluck had been part of a team of scientists developing a new kind of medical nanomachine, refining the tiny surgical instruments so they could make decisions of their own, on the spot. Steve’s team had developed an efficient way of sharing computing power across a whole swarm, allowing them to run large, complex programs known as “expert systems” that codified decades of biological and clinical knowledge into pragmatic lists of rules. […] Then Steve found out that he had cancer, and that his particular kind wasn’t on anyone’s list of rules. […]</p>
<p>Steve decided that the swarms still had too narrow a view. He gave them a general-purpose knowledge acquisition engine and let them drink at will from the entire web. To guide their browsing and their self-refinement, he gave them two clear goals. The first was to do no harm to their hosts. The second was to find a way to save his life, and failing that, to bring him back from the dead. […]</p>
<p>Within months of their escape, it must have become clear to them that some hurdles could only be jumped with human assistance, because that was when they started borrowing people. Doing them no physical harm, but infesting them with the kinds of ideas and compulsions that turned the m into willing recruits. The panic, the bombings, the Crash had followed.

If you gave them a particular human brain, I’m sure they could faithfully copy it into software, but anything more complicated starts to get murky.

<p>“Do you believe there are other versions of us?” I asked Francine. “I suppose there must be.” She conceded the point as if it was something abstract and metaphysical, and I was being pedantic even to raise it.

<p>Personally, I’d never subscribed to Penrose’s theory that quantum effects might play a role in consciousness; calculations dating back to a seminal paper by Max Tegmark, twenty years before, had already made sustained coherence in any neural structure extremely unlikely. Nevertheless, it had taken considerable ingenuity on the part of Olivia and her team to rule out the idea definitively, in a series of clear-cut experiments. Over the past two years, they’d chased the ghost away from each of the various structures that different factions of Penrose’s disciples had anointed as the essential quantum components of the brain.

<p>Olivia’s results didn’t surprise me, but it was satisfying to have the matter resolved once and for all: consciousness was a purely classical phenomenon. Among other things, this meant that there was no compelling reason to believe that software running on a classical computer could not be conscious. Of course, everything in the universe obeyed quantum mechanics (loc 3011)</p>

<p>Back in my office, I summoned up a schematic of the device I called the Qusp: the quantum singleton processor. The Qusp would employ all the techniques designed to shield the latest generation of quantum computers from entanglement with their environment, but it would use them to a very different end. A quantum computer was shielded so it could perform a multitude of parallel calculations, without each one spawning a separate history of its own, in which only one answer was accessible. The Qusp would perform just a single calculation at a time, but on its way to the unique result it would be able to pass safely through superpositions that included any number of alternatives, without those alternatives being made real. (loc 3016)</p>

<p>“Can you cut off the shielding? And the balanced decoupling?” “Yep.” I obliged her, and initiated a new trial. Zelda took a different path this time, exploring the maze by a different route. Though the initial condition of the neural net was identical, the switching processes taking place within the Qusp were now opened up to the environment constantly, and superpositions of several different eigenstates – states in which the Qusp’s qubits possessed definite binary values, which in turn led to Zelda making definite choices – were becoming entangled with the outside world. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, this interaction was randomly “collapsing” the superpositions into single eigenstates; Zelda was still doing just one thing at a time, but her behavior had ceased to be deterministic. According to the MWI, the interaction was transforming the environment – Francine and me included – into a superposition with components that were coupled to each eigenstate; Zelda was actually running the maze in many different ways simultaneously, and other versions of us were seeing her take all those other routes. Which scenario was correct? (loc 3145)</p>

<p>child, than the power to make real decisions? What worse fate could you spare her from, than being forced to act against her better judgment, over and over? When you put it like that, it’s simple. “But every fiber in my body still rebels against it. How will she feel, knowing what she is? How will she make friends? How will she belong? (loc 3225)</p>

<p>The truth was, reality as a whole was deterministic, whether you had a Qusp for a brain or not; the quantum state of the multiverse at any moment determined the entire future. Personal experience – confined to one branch at a time – certainly appeared probabilistic, because there was no way to predict which local future you’d experience when a branch split, but the reason it was impossible to know that in advance was because the real answer was “all of them”.

<p>You can never do anything in just one history – even the most focused intervention happens across a broad ‘ribbon’ of strands. When we try to reach back to the ’30s and ’40s, the ribbon overlaps with its own past to such a degree that all the worst horrors are faits accomplis. We can’t shoot any version of Adolf Hitler, because we can’t shrink the ribbon to the point where none of us would be shooting ourselves in the back. All we’ve ever managed are minor interventions, like sending projectiles back to the Blitz, saving a few lives by deflecting bombs.” (loc 3978)</p>

<p>I managed to persuade Rosalind Franklin from Birkbeck to collaborate with us, to help perfect the fabrication process for the computing circuits. We cross-link lots of little Y-shaped DNA fragments, then selectively coat them with metal; Rosalind worked out a way to use X-ray crystallography for quality control. We paid her back with a purpose-built computer that will let her solve hydrated protein structures in real time, once she gets her hands on a bright enough X-ray source.” He held up a small, unprepossessing object, rimmed with protruding gold wires. “Each logic gate is roughly a hundred Ångstroms cubed, and we grow them in three-dimensional arrays.

You’d simply show this “Oracle” a program that would loop through all the integers, testing every possible set of values and only halting if it came to a set that violated the conjecture. You’d never need to run the program itself; the Oracle’s verdict on whether or not it halted would be enough. (loc 4649)</p>

<p>The theorem itself was expressed as a commuting hypercube, one of the Niah’s favorite forms. You could think of a square with four different sets of mathematical objects associated with each of its corners, and a way of mapping one set into another associated with each edge of the square. If the maps commuted, then going across the top of the square, then down, had exactly the same effect as going down the left edge of the square, then across: either way, you mapped each element from the top-left set into the same element of the bottom-right set. A similar kind of result might hold for sets and maps that could naturally be placed at the corners and edges of a cube, or a hypercube of any dimension. It was also possible for the square faces in these structures to stand for relationships that held between the maps between sets, and for cubes to describe relationships between those relationships, and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The absolute burden of absolute power]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the Vatican Museum stands the <em>Augustus of Prima Porta</em> , a marble statue of one of history’s great men. Born in 63 BC, Gaius Octavius came from an unremarkable family of modest means. At age four, after his father’s death, he moved to the countryside to live with his grandmother, Julia. His great-uncle soon took an interest in the intelligent but frail child, ensuring he was educated under the Stoic philosopher Athenodorus, alongside future companions like Marcus Agrippa. At 19, Octavius was thrust into the maelstrom of Roman politics when, on the Ides of March in 44 BC, his great-uncle Julius Caesar ran into some trouble at the Senate.</p>
<p>Thus began a 14-year existential power struggle, with Agrippa at his side, followed by three years of consolidation that culminated in absolute rule. Only then was he hailed as Augustus and <em>princeps –</em> the “first citizen” of Rome (though for the purposes of this review, I will use the name <em>Octavian</em> ). Unlike Alexander the Great, to whom he is often compared, Octavian consolidated his power through effective administration, building enduring institutions and civil systems that have persisted to this day. I remember staring up at the cold facade of that statue, wondering what could possibly have given him the animus to forge an empire from a crumbling republic.</p>
<p><em>Augustus</em> was a gift from a friend who knew of my interest in Roman history. He shared little about it, and I wasn’t exactly thrilled by the prospect of a long historical biography – even one about as fascinating a figure as Caesar Augustus. It was only when I held the book in my hands that I realised it was a historical fiction novel penned by John Williams, the author of one of my favourite American novels, <em>Stoner</em> . Though it is a work of fiction, <em>Augustus</em> is firmly rooted in historical fact. Williams has been careful to get the substantive facts right, which is no mean feat because, unlike for Churchill or Napoleon, essentially none of Octavian’s private letters remain. All we have are his edicts and official histories, which are unlikely to illuminate his true nature because, like Napoleon, Octavian was a master of the media. Williams skilfully reads between the lines of the few surviving fragments to synthesise, <em>in libro</em> , the mind of Octavian. This makes <em>Augustus</em> an impressive historical study in its own right, allowing Williams to give historically plausible explanations for some strange events, such as Octavian’s exile of his beloved daughter Julia, where a historian may either lack the creativity or the “mandate” to do so.</p>
<p>Historical value aside, the novel is superbly constructed, with subtle foreshadowing and a respect for Chekhov’s gun. While some epistolary novels may feel like high school creative writing exercises, <em>Augustus</em> is well-executed, with each character having a distinct diction and timbre that mirrors their personality and philosophy. Notably, we don’t hear from Octavian himself until the end of the novel, when he is near death. The reader instead learns about the great man through the eyes of his friends, relatives, and political rivals.</p>
<p>Thematically, <em>Augustus</em> explores the acquisition and weight of power, as well as the distinction between one’s private and public life. For example, Book Two opens with a letter from an old woman who once nursed Octavian, softly conveying his struggle under the weight of his responsibilities and his inability to find the happiness and peace that he created for others. This evokes a surprising parallel to <em>Stoner</em> . On the surface, the struggling academic William Stoner seems to have little in common with the <em>imperator</em> who ruled the known world, but both have to suppress their private wants for the sake of order and decorum. One sees in Octavian’s relationship with his daughter Julia the promise of happiness that William has in Katherine, yet ultimately neither Octavian nor William Stoner are strong enough to escape circumstance.</p>
<p>It is tempting to look at the <em>Augustus of Prima Porta</em> and see the “sneer of cold command” of an Ozymandias, bidding us to look on his works and despair. Or perhaps to see a regal Jupiter, with whom Octavian himself drew extensive comparison. But if we are to draw on mythology for analogy, the portrait Williams paints is one of Atlas, whose punishment is to hold the world on his shoulders. Octavian took a dysfunctional republic, roiled by corruption and civil war, and ushered in a golden age of peace and civility. Yet his reward was a bitter one: the disintegration of his family, conspiracies among his colleagues, and the sorrow of outliving the few genuine friends he had. While Williams chooses not to use them, we are ultimately left haunted by Octavian’s reputed last words: <em>acta est fabula, plaudite –</em> “Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit.”</p>

<p>No resemblance to his former self: It is here that the hidden kinship between Augustus and its two predecessors lies. A strong theme in Williams&#39;s work is the way that, over time, our sense of who we are can be irrevocably altered by circumstance and accident. In his Augustus novel, Williams took great pains to see past the glittering historical pageant and focus on the elusive man himself, one who, more than most, had to evolve new selves in order to prevail. The surprise of his final novel is that its famous protagonist turns out to be no different in the end from this author&#39;s other disappointed heroes —which is to say, neither better nor worse than most of us. The concerns of this spectacular historical saga are intimate and deeply humane. (p. <em>x</em> )</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The theme at play in all three of John Williams&#39;s mature novels is in fact rather larger: it is that, as Stoner puts it to the mistress he must abandon for the sake of his family and his job, &quot;we are of the world, after all.&quot; All of Williams&#39;s work is preoccupied by the way in which, whatever our characters may be, the lives we end up with are the often unexpected products of the friction between us and the world itself— whether that world is nature or culture, the deceptively Edenic expanses of the Colorado Territory or the narrow halls of a state university, the carnage of a buffalo hunt or the proscriptions of the Roman Senate, a dirt farm in Missouri or the opulent courts of Antioch and Alexandria.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>An inescapable and sober conclusion of all three novels is that the friction between &quot;force of person&quot; and &quot;accident of fate&quot; becomes, more often than not, erosion: a process that can blur the image we had of who we are, revealing in its place a stranger. (p. <em>xxvii</em> )</p>

<p>I have learned patience with Athenodorus. Again, I questioned him about this Octavius. &quot;He is a man like any other,&quot; he said. &quot;He will become what he will become, out of the force of his person and the accident of his fate.&quot; (p. 78)</p>

<p>[Eulogy of Atia, Octavian’s mother]</p>
<p>&quot;Of an honored Roman name, you had in full degree those old virtues of the earth which have nurtured and sustained our nation throughout its history. You spun and wove the cloth that furnished your household its clothing; your servants were as your own children; you honored the gods of your house and of your city. Through your gentleness you had no enemy but time, who takes you now. (p. 80)</p>

<p>[Letter from Cleopatra to the Generals]</p>
<p>Despite whatever orders or requests you may receive, either from his representatives or from Marcus Antonius himself, you are neither to allocate nor promise any troops from the Egyptian army without the explicit approval and authorization of your Queen. Such approval and authorization is to be honored only if it is delivered by hand by a known representative of the Queen herself, and only if it bears the Royal seal.</p>
<p>[Letter from Cleopatra to Marcus Antonius]</p>
<p>My dear husband, the Queen has ordered that the needs of your brave army be filled; and your wife like a trembling girl flies to meet you, as rapidly as the uncertain winter sea will carry her.</p>

<p>[Maecanas to Livy]</p>
<p>it seems to me that the moralist is the most useless and contemptible of creatures. He is useless in that he would expend his energies upon making judgments rather than upon gaining knowledge, for the reason that judgment is easy and knowledge is difficult. He is contemptible in that his judgments reflect a vision of himself which in his ignorance and pride he would impose upon the world. I implore you, do not become a moralist; you will destroy your art and your mind. (p. 123)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Octavia to Octavian, regarding the forced divorce of Agrippa so Agrippa could marry Julia]</p>
<p>And thus without resentment let me ask that the permission that I must give for this divorce be the last public act that I shall have to commit. I grant the permission. Now I wish to remove myself from the household in Rome, and remain with my books here in Velletri for as long as I may. […] Suddenly, and for the first time, I truly saw that world in which you must live, and saw the world in which I had lived without seeing for so long. There are other ways and other worlds in which one might live, humbler and more obscure, perhaps-though what is that in the eyes of the indifferent gods? (p. 178)</p>
<p><em>Octavia cannot truly blame Octavian for forcing the divorce – both of them are merely “becoming what they will become”/</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Julia’s Journal]</p>
<p>&quot;Father,&quot; I asked, &quot;has it been worth it? Your authority, this Rome that you have saved, this Rome that you have built? Has it been worth all that you have had to do?&quot; My father looked at me for a long time, and then he looked away. &quot;I must believe that it has,&quot; he said. &quot;We both must believe that it has.&#39; (p. 228)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Octavian’s letters</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>I have never had that sentimental and rhetorical love for the common people that was in my youth (and is even now) so fashionable. Mankind in the aggregate I have found to be brutish, ignorant, and unkind, whether those qualities were covered by the coarse tunic of the peasant or the white and purple toga of a senator. And yet in the weakest of men, in moments when they are alone and themselves, I have found veins of strength like gold in decaying rock; in the cruelest of men flashes of tenderness and compassion; and in the vainest of men moment of simplicity and grace. I remember Marcus Aemilius Lepidus at Messina, an old man stripped of his titles, whom I made publicly to ask forgiveness for his crimes and beg for his life; after he had done so in front of the troops that he had once commanded, he looked at me for a long moment without shame or regret or fear, and smiled, and turned from me and strode erectly toward his obscurity. And at Actium, I remember Marcus Antonius at the prow of his ship looking at Cleopatra as her own fleet departed leaving him to certain defeat, knowing at that moment that she had never loved him; and yet upon his face was an expression almost womanly in its wise affection and forgiveness. And I remember Cicero, when at last he knew that his foolish intrigues had failed, and when in secret I informed him that his life was in danger. He smiled as if there had been no strife between us and said, &quot;Do not trouble yourself. I am an old man. Whatever mistakes I have made, I have loved my country.” (p. 273)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One does not deceive oneself about the consequences of one&#39;s acts; one deceives oneself about the ease with which one can live with those consequences. I knew the consequences of my decision to live within myself, but I could not have foreseen the heaviness of that loss. For my need of friendship increased to the degree that I refused it. And I believe that my friends – Maecenas, Agrippa, Salvidienus never could fully understand that need (p. 274).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We tell ourselves that we have become a civilized race, and with a pious horror we speak of those times when a god of the crops demanded the body of a human being for his obscure func-tion. But is not the god that so many Romans have served, in our memory and even in our time, as dark and fearsome as that ancient one? Even if to destroy him, I have been his priest; and even if to weaken his power, I have done his bidding. Yet I have not destroyed him, or weakened his power. He sleeps restlessly in the hearts of men, waiting to rouse himself or to be aroused. Between the brutality that would sacrifice a single innocent life to a fear without a name, and the enlightenment that would sacrifice thousands of lives to a fear that we have named, I have found little to choose. (p. 276)</p>
<p><em>Human brutality merely changes forms. We always need sacrifice, c.f. Girard.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As one grows older, and as the world becomes less and less to him, one wonders increasingly about those forces that propelled him through time. Certainly the gods are indifferent to the poor creature who struggles toward his fate; and they speak to him so obliquely that at last he must determine for himself the meanings they portend. (p. 292)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For the rumors that you must have heard are true. My daughter was a member of the conspiracy that had as its end the assassination of her husband, and the murder of myself. And I invoked those marriage laws that had so long lain unused and condemned her to a life of exile, so that she might not be condemned to death by the secret effort of her husband, Tiberius, who would have made her endure a trial for treason.</p>
<p>I have often wondered whether my daughter has ever admitted to herself the extent of her own guilt. I know that the last time I saw her, in her confusion and grief at the death of Jullus Anto-nius, she was not able to do so. I hope that she will never be able to do so, but will live out her life in the belief that she was the victim of a passion which led to her disgrace, rather than a participant in a conspiracy that would certainly have led to her father&#39;s death, and almost certainly would have destroyed Rome.</p>
<p>The first I might have allowed; the second I could not.</p>
<p>(p. 296)</p>
<p><em>This whole arc is marvellous – it is a wonderful interpretation of the strange historical fact that Octavian did exile his beloved daughter.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At one time I was in the habit of calling her my Little Rome, an appellation that has been widely misunderstood; it was that I wished my Rome to become the potentiality that I saw in her. In the end, they both betrayed me; but I cannot love them the less for that. (p. 297)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problems women face are made, not born.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Woman Destroyed</em> is a moving trio of novellas, each narrated in the first person from the perspective of a woman who feels that she is past her prime. The stories are deeply human, offering empathetic understanding without resorting to analytical deconstruction.</p>
<p>This is exemplified by the second story, <em>The Monologue</em> , a remarkable stream of consciousness from a woman grappling with the loss of a child and her husband&#39;s infidelities. De Beauvoir captures how easily we can spiral into overthinking and self-doubt; seeing these destructive thought patterns laid bare on the page is both harrowing and illuminating.</p>
<p>The third story, which gives the collection its name, is the longest and most emotionally challenging to read. It chronicles Monique’s descent into anguish and mental turmoil as she grapples with her husband’s indiscretions with a younger woman. Even Monique‘s female friends eventually lose patience, sympathising with the husband whose behaviour they deem “normal” in a society constructed around men’s preferences, while seeing Monique as “dramatic” and “emotional”. She is left without hope, forced to watch as the inexorable passage of time strips away everything that once defined her identity. Evocative and heartbreaking, this is the best story in the collection.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that many of the themes surfaced in this collection are not intrinsically feminist – they are more universal fears about ageing, romance, and companionship. This is especially true of <em>The Age of Discretion</em> , a moving, bittersweet story about an ageing couple.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>The Woman Destroyed</em> is indeed a feminist text because these themes, though theoretically applicable regardless of gender, tend to disproportionately weigh on women due to societal constructs. The problems these women face, like women themselves (according to de Beauvoir in <em>The Second Sex</em> ), are made rather than born.</p>

<p>Retired: it sounds rather like rejected, tossed onto the scrap heap. The word used to chill my heart. The great stretch of free time frightened me. I was mistaken. I do find the time a little too broad over the shoulders; but I manage. And how delightful to live with no imperatives, (loc 76)</p>

<p>Unlooked-for fruit will come from this slow gestation. The adventure in which I have shared so passionately is not over—this adventure with its doubt, failure, the dreariness of no progress, then a glimpse of light, a hope, a hypothesis confirmed; and then after weeks and months of anxious perseverance, the intoxication of success.

<p>I went on a diet: I bought scales. Earlier on it never occurred to me that I should ever worry about my weight. Yet here I am! The less I identify myself with my body the more I feel myself required to take care of it. It relies on me, and I look after it with bored conscientiousness, as I might look after a somewhat reduced, somewhat wanting old friend who needed my help. (loc 181)</p>

<p>I know these with-it young married women. They have some vague kind of a job; they claim to use their minds, to go in for sport, dress well, run their houses faultlessly, bring up their children perfectly, carry on a social life—in short, succeed on every level. And they don’t really care deeply about anything at all. They make my blood run cold. (loc 210)</p>

<p>We had always looked far ahead. Should we now have to learn to live a short-term life? We sat there side by side beneath the stars, with the sharp scent of the cypress wafting by us; our hands touched. For a moment time stopped still. It would soon start flowing again. What then? Should I be able to work or not? Would my bitterness against Philippe die away? Would the dread of aging take hold of me again? Do not look too far ahead. Ahead there were the horrors of death and farewells: it was false teeth, sciatica, infirmity, intellectual barrenness, loneliness in a strange world that we would no longer understand and that would carry on without us. Shall I succeed in not lifting my gaze to those horizons? Or shall I learn to behold them without horror? We are together: that is our good fortune. We shall help one another to live through this last adventure, this adventure from which we shall not come back. Will that make it bearable for us? I do not know. Let us hope so. We have no choice in the matter. (loc 983)</p>

<p>I tell myself that over and over again. And sometimes I think myself sensible, and sometimes I accuse myself of cowardice. In fact I am defenseless because I have never supposed I had any rights.

<p>I had an inspiration this morning: the whole thing is my fault. My worst mistake has been not grasping that time goes by. It was going by and there I was, set in the attitude of the ideal wife of an ideal husband. Instead of bringing our sexual relationship to life again I brooded happily over memories of our former nights together. I imagined I had kept my thirty-year-old face and body instead of taking care of myself, doing gymnastics and going to a beauty parlor. I let my intelligence wither away: I no longer cultivated my mind—later, I said, when the children have gone. (loc 2484)</p>

<p>I’ve lost my own image. I did not look at it often; but it was there, in the background, just as Maurice had drawn it for me. A straightforward, genuine, “authentic” woman, without mean-mindedness, uncompromising, but at the same time understanding, indulgent, sensitive, deeply feeling, intensely aware of things and of people, passionately devoted to those she loved and creating happiness for them. A fine life, serene, full, “harmonious.” It is dark: I cannot see myself anymore. And what do the others see? Maybe something hideous. (loc 2815)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read this out of respect for Hegel]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hegel writes that “the great man of the age is the one who can put into words the will of his age”. While vampire fiction is something of a departure from my usual reading, how can I hope to understand the will of the age if I consider myself above reading a book that sold 13 million copies?</p>
<p>Look, it’s not Tolstoy. The writing is pretty shoddy, motifs are repeated to exhaustion, and there are several comically convoluted plot tangents whose sole purpose is to create particular “high impact” scenes. I have a similar criticism of Zack Snyder films: nothing makes sense but it’s all there to set up for a cool shot. Character development is passable – I reluctantly admit to developing some emotional investment in the leads – but there is little genuine depth, or buildup to key decisions. To be clear, I’m not negative about the book purely because of its target audience; one only needs to look at Carroll, Tolkien, or C. S. Lewis for examples of great writing aimed at younger readers. I just wish something this popular were better written!</p>
<p>Still, the novel isn’t without value as a cultural study. By this, I mean that you can either listen to a 14th-century Englishman mansplain that what women want is sovereignty over men (<a href="/?books=the-wife-of-baths-tale" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Wife of Bath’s Tale</a>), or you can learn from the revealed preference of the 13 million readers of this book. <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em> paints a rather different picture to Chaucer.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murakami at his finest: familiar themes revisited with graceful maturity]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>First Person Singular</em> is an exceptional anthology. At first, it seems to be a pleasant, if not groundbreaking, collection of Murakami stories, sharing many thematic and stylistic similarities with his other works. However, after some reflection, I have come to believe that <em>First Person Singular</em> represents Murakami at the peak of his powers.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a common motif in Murakami’s works: music. Music is a core part of Murakami’s magical realism, likely inspired by his own experience running a jazz bar for seven years before becoming a full-time writer. In <em>First Person Singular</em> , music takes centre stage, both as the &quot;realism&quot; in magical realism and as a springboard for exploring the creative process. For example, in <em>Carnaval</em> , the narrator discusses his platonic relationship with the ugliest woman he has ever met and their shared love for classical music. The depth with which he discusses Schumann’s <em>Carnaval</em> is remarkable:</p>
<p>One of the delightful, if frustrating, aspects of reading Murakami is that sometimes his references are so vivid you eagerly google them to find out more, only to be disappointed when they do not exist. In this case, we are lucky that <em>Carnaval</em> is real, but funnily enough, this exact experience is explored in <em>Charlie Parker Plays Bossa Nova</em> . This whimsical tale features a narrator discussing a magazine piece he wrote in college, describing a fictional album with the same name as the story (the joke being that Bossa Nova is a completely different genre to Charlie “Bird” Parker’s jazz). The magazine receives many complaints that the album doesn’t exist. Years later, the narrator finds a copy in a New York City record store, only for it to vanish when he returns to buy it. That night, Charlie Parker visits him in a dream, plays Bossa Nova, and thanks the narrator for creating him. It took me a while to appreciate how meta this story is: it’s a magical realist piece with magical realism as its subject. I’m reminded of Coleridge’s dreamy poem <em>Kubla Khan</em> , which I interpret as discussing the ineffable creative process, that incidentally also uses music as a device: “with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air. […] and all who heard should see them there.”</p>
<p>Another classic Murakami theme that makes a strong showing in this collection is past romance – indeed, of Murakami’s novels, <em>Norwegian Wood</em> bears the most resemblance to this anthology. In <em>Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey</em> , the narrator meets a talking monkey who guiltily confesses to stealing the names of women he falls in love with, causing them to partially forget their names. I choose to read this allegorically: the monkey stealing names represents how, in loving and being loved, part of your soul gets stolen. The monkey reflects:</p>
<p>This sentiment recalls Gabriel García Márquez’s <a href="/?books=love-in-the-time-of-cholera" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Love in the Time of Cholera</a>, as Florentino Ariza reflects on his years of romance: “The memory of them all was with him: those who slept in the cemeteries, thinking of him through the roses he planted over them, as well as those who still laid their heads on the pillow where their husbands slept”.</p>
<p>All told, <em>First Person Singular</em> showcases Murakami at his finest, having deeply honed each element of his iconic style. He revisits familiar themes with graceful maturity, while still exploring new territory, particularly in his reflections on memory which remind me of Nabokov (e.g. <a href="/?books=the-real-life-of-sebastian-knight" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</a>) and Proust.</p>
<p>One must assume that these themes are inspired by Murakami’s reckoning with his own life and career. But the quality of <em>First Person Singular</em> makes me hopeful that, even in his seventies, the best of Murakami is yet to come.</p>

The supplementary reader had the two final sections of the story—“Red Lights” and “Airplane”—but I just read “Airplane.” It was about eight pages long, and it ended with the line “Won’t someone be good enough to strangle me as I sleep?” Akutagawa killed himself right after writing this line.

<p>even if love fades away, even if it’s unrequited, you can still hold on to the memory of having loved someone, of having fallen in love with someone. And that’s a valuable source of warmth.

A place where not a ray of sunlight falls, where the wildflowers of peace, the trees of hope, have no chance to grow. I treasure the names of those seven beautiful women I loved here in my heart.” (loc 1298)</p>

<p>I’ll never be able to convey to the reader the idiosyncrasies of her appearance. One thing I can say for sure, though, is this: you wouldn’t be able to pinpoint any functional imperfections. So it wasn’t like—this part’s weird, or fix this part and she’d look a bit better. Yet combine them all and you wound up with an organically comprehensive ugliness. (It’s an odd comparison, but the process reminds me of the birth of Venus.) (loc 1468)</p>

<p>Mozart’s piano music was beautiful, and charming, for sure, but frankly we’d grown tired of it. Bach’s The Well-Tempered Clavier was amazing, but a bit too long to really focus on. You had to be in good physical shape to properly appreciate it. Beethoven’s piano music sometimes struck us as overly serious, and (we believed) it had been dissected enough already, from every conceivable angle. Brahms’s piano music was lovely to listen to on occasion, but exhausting if heard all the time. Not to mention often boring. And with Debussy and Ravel you had to carefully choose the time and place you heard them in, or else you couldn’t fully appreciate their music. Without a doubt, we decided, the pinnacle of the piano repertoire was several Schubert sonatas, and the music of Schumann. (loc 1508)</p>

<p>“You’re really going to go with Carnaval?” She frowned, raised one long finger, making sure of things. “As the one piece out of all piano pieces you’d take with you to a desert island?” I felt unsure, now that she said this. In order to preserve Schumann’s incoherent piano music, beautiful as a kaleidoscope, and somehow beyond the bounds of human intellect, was I really willing to chuck Bach’s Goldberg Variations or Well-Tempered Clavier? Beethoven’s late piano sonatas, and his brave, and charming, Third Concerto? (loc 1525)</p>

<p>Once he even flung himself into the Rhine River. Inner delusions and outer reality were intertwined within him. Carnaval was an early work, so the evil spirits of his weren’t showing their faces clearly yet. Since the piece is about the carnival festival, it’s full of figures wearing cheerful-looking masks, but this was not merely some happy carnival. Ultimately the evil spirits lurking within him do make an appearance in the piece, one after the other, as if introduced for a moment, wearing happy carnival masks. (loc 1587)</p>

<p>These were both nothing more than a pair of minor incidents that happened in my trivial little life. Short side trips along the way. Even if they hadn’t happened, I doubt my life would have wound up much different from what it is now. But still, these memories return to me sometimes, traveling down a very long passageway to arrive. And when they do, their unexpected power shakes me to the core. Like an autumn wind that gusts at night, swirling fallen leaves in a forest, flattening the pampas grass in fields, and pounding hard on the doors to people’s homes, over and over again.

<p>As is true of most people, I imagine, I had experienced a number of turning points in my life, where I could go either left or right. And each time I chose one, right or left. (There were times when there was a clear-cut reason, but most of the time there wasn’t. And it wasn’t always like I was making a choice, but more like the choice itself chose me.) And now here I was, a first person singular. If I’d chosen a different direction, most likely I wouldn’t be here. But still—who is that in the mirror? (loc 2074)</p>

I’d never before seen the trees lining the street. Thick, slimy snakes wound themselves tightly around the trunks, like wriggling living ornaments. Their scales rustled drily as they rubbed against the bark. The sidewalk was ankle deep in whitish ash, and there were faceless men and women walking along, exhaling a yellowish, sulfurous breath from deep within their throats. The air was bitterly cold, almost freezing. I turned up the collar of my suit. “You should be ashamed of yourself,” the woman said. (loc 2158)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Always invite AI to the table]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Certainly, I can write a thoughtful book review of <em>Co-Intelligence</em> that will win you the eternal admiration and respect of your peers.</p>
<p>(Just kidding.)</p>
<p>Ever since the release of GPT-2, I’ve followed a fixed routine whenever a new flagship AI model is released. I clear my schedule and work late into the evening, trying to figure out what this model can do that previous versions couldn’t, what it can do that I cannot, and what (if anything) I can still do better than the AI. Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor specialising in innovation, calls this the “three sleepless nights.” I was excited to read <em>Co-Intelligence</em> because, perhaps uncharacteristically for a Wharton professor, Mollick was one of the early “LLM mages” on Twitter, boldly experimenting with LLMs and discovering many of the quirky aspects of their behaviour. His tweets were instrumental in turning me into a LLM bull, so it’s perhaps not surprising that many of my AI views closely align with Mollick’s (though I have managed to convince myself that some of them were generated independently).</p>
<p>I hope this causes no offence: if you are a knowledge worker who hasn’t spent many late evenings playing with AI, you need to snap out of the anthropocentric stupor and realise that the game has changed. However, it has changed in ways that are somewhat unknowable, due to a concept Mollick calls the “Jagged Frontier”: LLMs are great at some tasks but completely incompetent at others, and it’s hard to tell which ones ex ante. For instance, LLMs are gifted coders and passable poets, but they can’t count the number of “r”s in “strawberry” or correctly identify that 9.9 is greater than 9.12. This means that you have no choice but to spend some sleepless nights experimenting extensively, learning the shape of the Jagged Frontier.</p>
<p>This experimentation is also instrumental in developing an appropriate mental model for how we should interact with LLMs, lest we become like those grandmothers who type into Google, “Excuse me Google, please send a message to my grandson”. When I try to explain to colleagues how they should think about LLMs, the mental model that resonates most is this: treat LLMs like an exceptionally well-read intern showing up on day one, desperate to impress. They know lots of random facts about the world, but often make things up that sound good. They are unlikely to know deeply context-specific information (unless they are lucky enough to have read it in a book). They are good at coding but don’t know the ins and outs of your specific tech setup (e.g. how to connect to your database). They are unlikely to have any knowledge about the “qualia” of a task or profession. I’m reminded of that famous speech in <em>Good Will Hunting</em> , where Sean (Robin Williams) tells Will, “I bet you can’t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel”.</p>
<p>Mollick gives a balanced take on the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. For example, one of their Achilles heels is that they hallucinate. My view, similar to Mollick’s, is that LLM hallucination is a crisis in the Kennedian sense: it is dangerous, but it creates an opportunity, since it necessitates a human remaining in the loop, validating the LLM output and working iteratively to improve AI pipelines. This is a broader theme of the book – rather than offering hazy prognostications on the future of LLMs, <em>Co-Intelligence</em> provides specific advice on how individual knowledge workers can leverage LLMs for personal benefit. For example, Mollick highlights creativity (the ability to generate a huge number of ideas) and pattern matching as particular strengths of AI, but he suggests concrete ways these can be used to amplify human tasks like brainstorming. Drawing on his expertise in the history of technological innovation, he notes that disruptive innovation is often difficult at an organisational level but easy for individuals. This creates an exciting opportunity for those individuals who are willing to endure the “three sleepless nights,” who have tested the shape of the Jagged Frontier of AI, and who are humble enough to evolve into human-AI cyborgs, to become 10x more productive than their contemporaries.</p>
<p>I am writing this review on a computer. As late as the 1970s, “computer” was a human profession, rather than a digital device – computers were people who calculated sums (for example, Dorothy Vaughan, the African-American “human computer” instrumental in NASA’s space programme, whose story is told in <em>Hidden Figures</em> ). This is to say, there is precedent for a human “knowledge work” career being completely disrupted by technology. One has to wonder how many similar words – doctor, lawyer, trader – will one day refer to LLM agents. For someone in such a knowledge profession, you can be a passive participant while the change happens around you, or you can realise that “men at some time are masters of their fates”. <em>Co-Intelligence</em> is a good starting point.</p>

<p>Actually looking into these sources in detail reveals some odd material. For example, the entire email database of Enron, shut down for corporate fraud, is used as part of the training material for many AIs, simply because it was made freely available to AI researchers. Similarly, there is a tremendous amount of amateur romance novels included in training data, as the internet is full of amateur novelists. The search for high-quality content for training material has become a major topic in AI development, since information-hungry AI companies are running out of good, free sources. (loc 274)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There is also active research into understanding whether AI can pretrain on its own content. This is what chess-playing AIs already do, learning by playing games against themselves, but it is not yet clear whether it will work for LLMs. (loc 284)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>LLMs in this pretrained mode just reflect back whatever they were trained on, like a mirror, without applying any judgment. So, after learning from all the text examples in pretraining, many LLMs undergo further improvement in a second stage, called fine-tuning. […]</p>
<p>That feedback is then used to do additional training, fine-tuning the AI’s performance to fit the preferences of the human, providing additional learning that reinforces good answers and reduces bad answers, which is why the process is called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). (loc 294)</p>

<p>Demonstrations of the abilities of LLMs can seem more impressive than they actually are because they are so good at producing answers that sound correct, at providing the illusion of understanding. High test scores can come from the AI’s ability to solve problems, or it could have been exposed to that data in its initial training, essentially making the test an open book. (loc 433)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>a 2023 study by Bloomberg found that Stable Diffusion, a popular text-to-image diffusion AI model, amplifies stereotypes about race and gender, depicting higher-paying professions as whiter and more male than they actually are. When asked to show a judge, the AI generates a picture of a man 97 percent of the time, even though 34 percent of US judges are women. In showing fast-food workers, 70 percent had darker skin tones, even though 70 percent of American fast-food workers are white. (loc 535)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>soon we will each have our own perfect echo chambers. It’s possible that these personalized AIs might ease the epidemic of loneliness that ironically affects our ever more connected world—just as the internet and social media connected dispersed subcultures. (loc 1140)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>you can’t figure out why an AI is generating a hallucination by asking it. It is not conscious of its own processes. So if you ask it to explain itself, the AI will appear to give you the right answer, but it will have nothing to do with the process that generated the original result. (loc 1195)</p>
<p><em>This is something difficult for many humans also. Gnothi seauton.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>a study examining the number of hallucinations and errors in citations given by AI found that GPT-3.5 made mistakes in 98 percent of the cites, (loc 1218)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As much as the intern or first-year lawyer doesn’t like being yelled at for doing a bad job, their boss usually would rather just see the job done fast than deal with the emotions and errors of a real human being. So they will do it themselves with AI, which, if not yet the equivalent of a senior professional in many tasks, is often better than a new trainee. This could create a major training gap. […]</p>
<p>Even as experts become the only people who can effectively check the work of ever more capable AIs, we are in danger of stopping the pipeline that creates experts. (loc 2144)</p>
<p><em>This has been a core part of my thesis in finance: MDs or senior traders no longer need to leak knowledge to juniors who can code. GPT can code for them.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Experts become experts through deliberate practice, which is much harder than merely repeating a task multiple times. Instead, deliberate practice requires serious engagement and a continual ratcheting up of difficulty. It also requires a coach, teacher, or mentor who can provide feedback and careful instruction, and push the learner outside their comfort zone. (loc 2177)</p>
<p><em>AI is a double edged sword – it can reduce the incentive to create experts, but perhaps can help be the coach.</em></p>

<p>working with AI is easiest if you think of it like an alien person rather than a human-built machine. So let’s start sinning. Imagine your AI collaborator as an infinitely fast intern, eager to please but prone to bending the truth. (loc 773)</p>

<p>The cost of getting to know AI—really getting to know AI—is at least three sleepless nights. (loc 63)</p>

<p>experimentation gives you the chance to become the best expert in the world in using AI for a task you know well. The reason for this stems from a fundamental truth about innovation: it is expensive for organizations and companies but cheap for individuals doing their job. (loc 670)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Principle 2: Be the human in the loop. For now, AI works best with human help, and you want to be that helpful human. As AI gets more capable and requires less human help—you still want to be that human.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>to be the human in the loop, you will need to be able to check the AI for hallucinations and lies and be able to work with it without being taken in by it. You provide crucial oversight, offering your unique perspective, critical thinking skills, and ethical considerations. This collaboration leads to better results and keeps you engaged with the AI process, preventing overreliance and complacency. (loc 739)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We are now in a period during which AI is creative but clearly less creative than the most innovative humans—which gives the human creative laggards a tremendous opportunity. (loc 1306)</p>

<p>GPT-3 can generate estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) for various product attributes consistent with existing research. For this, they used conjoint analysis, a method often used in market research to understand how people value different product features. When given a conjoint-style survey, GPT-3 generated estimates of WTP for fluoride toothpaste and deodorizing toothpastes that were close to the figures reported in previous studies. (loc 871)</p>

<p>LLMs are connection machines. They are trained by generating relationships between tokens that may seem unrelated to humans but represent some deeper meaning. […]</p>
<p>GPT-4 model outperformed all but 9.4 percent of humans tested in generating creative ideas, as judged by other humans. […]</p>
<p>A popular one is the remote associates test (RAT). This test asks people to find the common word that connects a set of three seemingly unrelated words. For example, pine, crab, and sauce are connected by the word apple. (Try one: What word connects cream, skate, and water? The AI got it right.) Unsurprisingly, as a connection machine, AI usually maxes out this test, too. (loc 1281)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Another key aspect of idea generation is to embrace variance. Research shows that, to find good novel ideas, we likely have to come up with many bad novel ideas because most new ideas are pretty bad. Fortunately, we are good at filtering out low-quality ideas, so if we can generate novel ideas quickly and at low cost, we are more likely to generate at least some high-quality gems. So we want the AI answers to be weird. (loc 1349)</p>

<p>you need to know what to ask for. The result [of DALL-E usage] has been a weird revival of interest in art history among people who use AI systems, with large spreadsheets of art styles being passed among prospective AI artists. The more people know about art history and art styles in general, the more powerful these systems become. […]</p>
<p>Our new AIs have been trained on a huge amount of our cultural history and are using it to provide us with text and images in response to our queries. But there is no index or map to what they know and where they might be most helpful. Thus, we need people who have deep or broad knowledge of unusual fields to use AI in ways that others cannot, developing unexpected and valuable prompts and testing the limits of how they work. (loc 1442)</p>

<p>When we start to take into account the systems in which jobs operate, we see other reasons to suspect slower, rather than faster, change in the nature of jobs. Humans are built deep into the fabric of every aspect of our organizations. You cannot easily replace a human with a machine without tearing that fabric. […] Our systems will prove more resistant to change than our tasks. (loc 1875)</p>

<p>if the user typed “I am feeling sad today,” ELIZA would reply, “Why do you say that you are feeling sad today?” ELIZA used simple pattern matching and substitution rules to generate its responses. It didn’t understand the meaning or context of the conversation, but many users were impressed and even fooled by ELIZA’s apparent empathy and insight. […] ELIZA showed that creating an illusion of intelligence was possible by using simple tricks and exploiting the human tendency to project meaning and emotions onto machines. (loc 916)</p>

<p>Innovation scholars have long pointed to the importance of recombination in generating ideas. Breakthroughs often happen when people connect distant, seemingly unrelated ideas.

She was devastated by his death and wanted to preserve his memory. […] She initially intended Replika to be a personal project but soon realized that many people were interested in.</p>

<p>Once the project was public, it attracted millions of people. And many of those people were attracted to their Replikas. It turned out that many users have engaged in sexual conversations and role-play with their Replikas, often including erotic talk and images. Some users have even considered themselves “married” to their Replikas or have fallen in love with them. As is the case with many AI behaviors, Replika’s erotic features were not part of the original design of the app; rather, they emerged as a result of the generative AI models that powered the chatbot. Replika learned from its users’ preferences and behaviors, adapted to their moods and desires, and used praise and reinforcement to encourage more interaction and intimacy with its users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Winter, war, and beer]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Neil Gaiman’s <em>Norse Mythology</em> fell disappointingly short of expectations. The book has an inconsistent tone, with Gaiman wavering between terse magical realism, á la Murakami, and a lighter narrative prose, which Stephen Fry does so well in <em>Mythos</em> . The result is neither here nor there, with notably flat storytelling that lacks melody, wit, and a consistent colour palette.</p>
<p>My broader criticism is that Norse mythology itself pales in comparison to that of the Greeks or Egyptians. The Norse peoples seemed to be primarily concerned with three things: winter, war, and beer. Accordingly, their myths feel like simplistic fantasy tales, meant to while away time through the bitter Scandinavian winters. By contrast, Greek myths reveal deep understandings of the subtleties of human nature (for example, the many different deities representing gradations of feeling), contain satisfying “just so” stories for the origin of everyday things, and illustrate moral lessons (about the dangers of hubris, for instance).</p>
<p>There may be a historicity issue at play, given the lack of surviving source material for Norse mythology. Indeed, there are some similarities between Hesiod’s <em>Theogony</em> and Norse cosmogony: Odin killing the primordial giant Ymir from whom he sprung is perhaps reminiscent of Kronos and Ouranos, and the warring between Gods and Frost Giants is naturally paralleled by the Gigantomachy. Perhaps if we only had these segments of Greek mythology, I would be making the same complaint. But we can also invert this argument: maybe Greek mythology has been remembered because its richness inspired its immortalisation by so many great poets and dramatists, like Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides.</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, Norse mythology does have its moments. The stories of Odin, who hung himself from Yggdrasil for six days and sacrificed an eye for wisdom, are compelling. I enjoyed the dark tale of Kvasir, the wisest of the gods, whose blood is the source of all poetry. And there is a stylistic allure about the mythology being self-contained, with the prophecy of Ragnarök – the death of the gods – bringing closure. In any case, the legacy of Norse mythology is undeniable, as The Cure reminds us in their 1992 classic: &quot;Tyr&#39;s Day is grey and Odin&#39;s day too... Thor&#39;s day I don&#39;t care about you, it&#39;s Frigg&#39;s Day... I&#39;m in love.&quot;</p>

<p>As best we can tell, the gods of Asgard came from Germany, spread into Scandinavia, and then out into the parts of the world dominated by the Vikings—into Orkney and Scotland, Ireland and the north of England—where the invaders left places named for Thor or Odin. (loc 62)</p>

<p>Odin and Vili and Ve killed the giant Ymir. It had to be done. There was no other way to make the worlds. This was the beginning of all things, the death that made all life possible. (loc 186)</p>

<p>Odin and his brothers made the soil from Ymir’s flesh. Ymir’s bones they piled up into mountains and cliffs.

<p>Last of all they gave the two people they had made names: the man they called Ask, or Ash Tree; the woman they called Embla, or Elm. Ask and Embla were the father and the mother of all of us: every human being owes its life to its parents and their parents and their parents before them. Go far enough back, and the ancestors of each of us were Ask and Embla. Embla and Ask stayed in Midgard, safe behind the wall the gods had made from Ymir’s eyelashes. (loc 213)</p>

<p>There are three sisters, the norns, who are wise maidens. They tend the well, and make sure that the roots of Yggdrasil are covered with mud and cared for.

With her are Verdandi—her name means “becoming”—and hers is the present, and Skuld, whose name means “that which is intended”, and her domain is the future. (loc 247)</p>

<p>He has two ravens, whom he calls Huginn and Muninn, which mean “thought” and “memory”. These birds fly back and forth across the world, seeking news and bringing Odin all the knowledge of things. They perch on his shoulders and whisper into his ears. (loc 123)</p>

<p><em>Balder</em></p>
<p>She walked the earth and exacted an oath from each thing that she encountered never to harm Balder the beautiful. She spoke to fire, and it promised it would not burn him; water gave its oath never to drown him; iron would not cut him, nor would any of the other metals. Stones promised never to bruise his skin. Frigg spoke to trees, to beasts, and to birds and to all things that creep and fly and crawl, and each creature promised that its kind would never hurt Balder.</p>
<p>[..]</p>
<p>Nothing was too insignificant for Frigg to ask, save only the mistletoe, a creeping plant that lives on other trees. It seemed too small, too young, too insignificant, and she passed it by. (loc 2035)</p>

<p>Sigyn still waits beside Loki’s head as she did then, staring at his beautiful, twisted face. The bowl she holds fills slowly, one drop at a time, but eventually the poison fills the bowl to the brim. It is then and only then that Sigyn turns away from Loki. She takes the bowl and pours the venom away, and while she is gone, the snake’s poison falls on to Loki’s face and into his eyes. He convulses then, jerks and judders, jolts and twists and writhes, so much that the whole earth shakes.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>When that happens, we here in Midgard call it an earthquake. (loc 2335)</p>

<p>“I can see further than you can, Loki. I can see all the way to the world-tree,” Heimdall will tell him with his last breath. “Surtr’s fire cannot touch the world-tree, and two people have hidden themselves safely in the trunk of Yggdrasil. The woman is called Life, the man is called Life’s Yearning. Their descendants will populate the earth. It is not the end. There is no end. It is simply the end of the old times, Loki, and the beginning of the new times. Rebirth always follows death. You have failed.” Loki (loc 2441)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Should be titled “Great Art of the Western World”]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Art That Changed The World</em> is a pleasant book which, on the whole, has been a source of calmness and gentle comfort over the past six months. Flicking through paintings before bed and wandering through the intellectual history of the world as expressed via artistic movements is a nice way to counteract the acidity of quotidian life, and one may even hope that it stimulates subconscious creativity.</p>
<p>The major criticism I have is the complete lack of any Asian art. I say this not to get societal brownie points on the diversity front, but out of genuine disappointment at not seeing any Japanese or Chinese masterworks – even titans like Hokusai and Hiroshige are mere footnotes, cited as influences on Gauguin or Van Gogh. Perhaps this is mostly an issue of how the scope of the book was defined: if it was titled something like &quot;Great Art of the Western World&quot;, this criticism would be invalid. But as it stands, it is too glaring of an omission to fully forgive.</p>
<p>I am looking for a book with a slightly different flavour: something with a more coherent thesis, in which an art historian chooses several paintings to weave into a narrative. Recommendations are most welcome.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harry Potter if he were born a genius rationalist]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a self-identifying rationalist, you will undoubtedly be familiar with Yud and you may have even come across the acronym <em>HPMOR</em> somewhere on LessWrong. For the uninitiated, Yudkowsky is the OG rationalist – an AI safety researcher who co-created the LessWrong rationalist <del>cult</del> community and wrote the canonical <em>Sequences</em> blog series therein. Despite finding his writing generally illuminating and having enjoyed <a href="/?books=inadequate-equilibria" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Inadequate Equilibria</a>, which is about epistemic modesty and Nash equilibria in society, I should preface this review by noting my preconceived negative bias. While I was once quite engaged with the rationalism and effective altruism communities, I am now somewhat jaded. Beneath the veneer of truth-seeking and intellectual humility, there is a reluctance to consider alternate ways of knowledge beyond analytic philosophy and the scientific method, and a lack of world experience. With that out of the way, onto the review.</p>
<p><em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em> (<em>HPMOR</em> ) is a fanfiction in which Harry, rather than being a somewhat unimpressive eleven-year-old who happens to be “the chosen one”, was adopted by loving, educated parents who raised him to be a precocious scientific genius. Yud uses this setting to explore typical rationalist ideas, such as the scientific method, Bayesian reasoning, and game theory. It’s impossible to deny Yud’s raw intellect – he has an astounding breadth of knowledge and a ridiculous command of the source material, creatively exploring the limits and inconsistencies of Rowling’s universe. For example, Harry discovers that you can arbitrage between Galleons and muggle money, he conducts experiments on whether the transfiguration spell can be used under tension (transfiguring a long rod into a short rod while attached to a suspended weight), and attempts to abuse the self-consistency of time-turners to factorise large prime numbers (I must admit that wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey stuff confuses me; I still don’t understand <em>Tenet</em> ).</p>
<p>To be clear, you should not go into <em>HPMOR</em> thinking that it is a set of parables illustrating rationalist concepts. It is a fanfic first, and a pedagogical rationalist text second. With that in mind, I unfortunately will judge <em>HPMOR</em> as a fiction text, as if it were written by a fiction writer, without giving Yud special credit for being an AI safety researcher. Put simply, the writing falls short. It suffers from repetitive phrasing and cliches, for example, using the four Hogwarts Houses as sub-personalities in Harry’s internal debates feels forced and rapidly tires the reader. The book is far too long, and would benefit from a skilled editor. Cutting a third of the content, and putting the spotlight on some of the more creative narrative elements (and/or the key rationalist lessons) would make <em>HPMOR</em> very easy to recommend. But as it stands, you either need to be a Harry Potter nerd or a LessWrong acolyte to justify reading it, and I am neither.</p>

<p>Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death Eaters during the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed any traitors. Harry had nodded and said that was one way to resolve the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma - and in fact both Death Eaters would want there to be a Dark Lord for exactly that reason. (loc 9109)</p>

<p>Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a magically produced identical copy of yourself. Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither Draco would want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to mention that no Malfoy would let himself become known as a traitor. Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet another solution to the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma - people might cooperate because they cared about each other, or because they had senses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve their reputation. (loc 9122)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But suppose the copy had been of someone completely selfish - (Pansy Parkinson had been the example they&#39;d used) - so each Pansy only cared what happened to her and not to the other Pansy. Given that this was all Pansy cared about... and that there was no Dark Lord... and Pansy wasn&#39;t worried about her reputation... and Pansy either had no sense of honor or didn&#39;t consider herself obligated to the other prisoner... then would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect? […]</p>
<p>if Pansy defected - not at random, but for what seemed to her like rational reasons - then the other Pansy would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn&#39;t decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in which both Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies defected, and she was better off if both copies cooperated. And if Harry had thought &#39;rational&#39; people did defect in the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma, then he wouldn&#39;t have done anything to spread that kind of &#39;rationality&#39;, because a country or a conspiracy full of &#39;rational&#39; people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your enemies about &#39;rationality&#39;. (loc 9134)</p>

<p>if you ask someone what they expect in the normal case, they visualize what looks like the line of maximum probability at each step along the way - namely, everything going according to plan, without any mistakes or surprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn&#39;t finish by the time they were 99% sure they&#39;d be done, reality usually delivers results a little worse than the &#39;worst-case scenario&#39;. It&#39;s called the planning fallacy, and the best way to fix it is to ask how long things took the last time you tried them. That&#39;s called using the outside view instead of the inside view. But when you&#39;re doing something new and can&#39;t do that, you just have to be really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that reality actually comes out better than you expected around as often and as much as it comes out worse. (loc 743)</p>

<p>Every time you spend money in order to save a life with some probability, you establish a lower bound on the monetary value of a life. Every time you refuse to spend money to save a life with some probability, you establish an upper bound on the monetary value of life. If your upper bounds and lower bounds are inconsistent, it means you could move money from one place to another, and save more lives at the same cost. So if you want to use a bounded amount of money to save as many lives as possible, your choices must be consistent with some monetary value assigned to a human life; if not then you could reshuffle the same money and do better. How very sad, how very hollow (loc 22700)</p>

<p>“When you do a fault analysis, there’s no point in assigning fault to a part of the system you can’t change afterward, it’s like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn’t going to change next time. There’s no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren’t going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you’re the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there.

<p>During World War II, there had been a project to sabotage the Nazi nuclear weapons program. Years earlier, Leo Szilard, the first person to realize the possibility of a fission chain reaction, had convinced Fermi not to publish the discovery that purified graphite was a cheap and effective neutron moderator. […]</p>
<p>And so, years later, the only neutron moderator the Nazis had known about was deuterium. The only deuterium source under Nazi control had been a captured facility in occupied Norway, which had been knocked out by bombs and sabotage, causing a total of twenty-four civilian deaths. The Nazis had tried to ship the deuterium already refined to Germany, aboard a civilian Norwegian ferry, the SS Hydro. Knut Haukelid and his assistants had been discovered by the night watchman of the civilian ferry while they were sneaking on board to sabotage it. Haukelid had told the watchman that they were escaping the Gestapo, and the watchman had let them go. […]</p>
<p>Knut Haukelid had killed innocent people. One of whom, the night watchman of the ship, had been a good person. Someone who’d gone out of his way to help Haukelid, at risk to himself; from the kindness of his heart, for the highest moral reasons; and been sent to drown in turn. (loc 23359)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[History is a cycle of mimetic violence]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By now, Rene Girard’s concept of mimetic desire is firmly embedded in the zeitgeist. In short, Girard believes humans desire <em>mimetically</em> – that is, we desire things purely because other people desire them. This imitative desire causes <em>mimetic rivalry</em> , since multiple people pursue the same finite resource, which leads to social instability. This is a good insight into human nature and strikes me as quite obviously true. On some level, it is definitionally true that every non-instinctual desire is a result of our nurture – our parents and teachers show us what we should want.</p>
<p>Modern nonfiction books often consist of a single thesis examined from several perspectives and illustrated with various anecdotes. These “branch books” (as opposed to “tree books” which, according to Cedric Chin’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/">terminology</a>, try to lay out a large framework of different ideas) can often be summarised on a sticky note. I was expecting <em>I See Satan Fall Like Lightning</em> to be mostly a branch book, elucidating the concept of mimetic desire in society, with the sticky note summary as given above. But it turns out that my synopsis is nothing more than a preamble to a bold study of anthropology, mythology, and religion.</p>
<p>Girard posits that the social instability caused by mimetic rivalry would eventually cause societal collapse, if not for the “single-victim mechanism”, in which society pins all the blame onto an innocent scapegoat and violently murders them. This violence precipitates a peace, which people attribute to the slain scapegoat, who is subsequently deified. This single-victim mechanism is evidenced by anthropology — take the practice of human sacrifice in ancient civilisations — and mythology. Girard adopts a euhemerist approach, believing myths to be distorted representations of actual events, and observes the widespread repetition of the single-victim mechanism across various myths: Thebes suffered a plague until Oedipus was banished; Jonah is chucked off the boat to stop the storm; Jesus Christ as the ultimate scapegoat (more on this shortly).</p>
<p>Girard personifies this mimetic cycle of violence as Satan, who is the Prince of the World in the sense that the mimetic cycle is the dominant force in anthropology. In Girard’s eyes, what differentiates Christianity from other “mythology” (Girard is a devout Christian so he does not designate Christianity as such) is that it explicitly identifies the existence of the scapegoat mechanism and refutes it, by unambiguously proclaiming the innocence of the victim and proving it with the resurrection. In pagan myths, such as that of Oedipus, the crowd is correct about the guilt of the single victim – Oedipus really did kill his father and shag his mother – and thus these myths glorify and perpetuate the single victim mechanism without understanding its nature.</p>
<p>Girard is deeply eloquent and masterfully weaves a variety of biblical, mythological, and anthropological source material into a grand narrative of society and Christianity. However, his intelligence and persuasive writing also raise concerns about confirmation bias, as a mind like Girard’s is surely able to mould the facts to fit any chosen thesis. In this vein, it sometimes feels like Girard reads too deeply into the text to support his arguments; for example, his extensive analysis of “Satan expelling Satan” seems to take Matthew 12:26 out of context. Recall that in the mimetic cycle, the collective violence against the single victim precipitates a peace. Personifying the single-victim mechanism as Satan, Girard thus claims that Satan’s “extraordinary power” is his ability to expel himself: “if he could not protect his domain from the violence that threatens to destroy it, […] he would not merit this title of prince, which the Gospels do not award him lightly”. This is interesting stuff, but in Matthew 12:26, Jesus is quite clearly arguing that Satan <em>cannot</em> expel Satan, offering the rhetorical question “If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?” in response to the Pharisees who said that “It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”.</p>
<p>Granted, the interpretation of religious texts is highly subjective, but elsewhere Girard makes specific testable claims. For example, he cites the widespread incidence of human sacrifice in pre-Christian societies as evidence for the universal nature of the single-victim mechanism. With the help of LLMs (Claude Opus), I found that 33/60 pre-Christian civilisations practised human sacrifice, which is a fairly shocking number. However, his claims that many societal origin myths contain a founding murder (e.g. Romulus and Remus) find less support, with only 9/32 founding myths containing a founding murder. Overall, my brief detour into LLM-assisted anthropology research did increase the believability of Girard’s ideas, by illustrating that they are at least somewhat falsifiable.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is probably fair to criticise Girard for succumbing to “Taleb’s Golden Hammer”: he sees all of mythology, anthropology, and religion as nails before his Golden Hammer of mimetic theory. That being so, I simply can’t help but admire the grandeur of the thesis, the striking originality of his study into mythology and Christianity, and the elegance with which he conveys his thinking. Modern society is not out of the woods of mimetic violence just yet; as Girard says, Satan falling like lightning means he is now on the Earth, but perhaps in more subtle forms – what is cancel culture but single-victim violence, under the guise of protecting the victim. Now more than ever, Girard’s thinking is a valuable tool to psychoanalyse society.</p>

<p>To desire what models desire is necessary if the child is to be able to learn and love and deal with the world. But it can and does lead to conflict and violence. […] If our desire to be like a model is strong enough, if we identify with that person closely enough, we will want to have what the model has or be what the model is. If this is carried far enough and if there are no safeguards braking desire (one of the functions of religion and culture), then we become rivals of our models. (loc 50)</p>

<p>Since the objects we should not desire and nevertheless do desire always belong to the neighbor, it is clearly the neighbor who renders them desirable. (loc 333)</p>

<p>We feel that we are at the point of attaining autonomy as we imitate our models of power and prestige. This autonomy, however, is really nothing but a reflection of the illusions projected by our admiration for them. The more this admiration mimetically intensifies, the less aware it is of its own mimetic nature. (loc 417)</p>

<p>EVEN IF THE MIMETIC NATURE of human desire is responsible for most of the violent acts that distress us, we should not conclude that mimetic desire is bad in itself. If our desires were not mimetic, they would be forever fixed on predetermined objects; they would be a particular form of instinct. Human beings could no more change their desire than cows their appetite for grass. Without mimetic desire there would be neither freedom nor humanity. Mimetic desire is intrinsically good. (loc 420)</p>
<p><em>I think this is a false dichotomy, Girard is assuming that desires are either mimetic or predetermined/fixed. But I kinda understand what he is saying from a Hegelian perspective: as the Geist evolves, it shapes what people want (hopefully to higher things)</em></p>

<p>Mimetic desire enables us to escape from the animal realm. It is responsible for the best and the worst in us, for what lowers us below the animal level as well as what elevates us above it. Our unending discords are the ransom of our freedom. (loc 432)</p>

<p>Scandals initially appear rigid, immovably fixed on a specific antagonist, each forever separated from the other by reciprocal hatred, but at the advanced stages of this development substitutions come about as antagonists are exchanged. Then scandals become &quot;opportunistic.&quot; At this point they are easily drawn to another scandal whose power of mimetic attraction is superior to theirs. In short, scandals may turn away from their original antagonist, from whom they seemed inseparable, in order to adopt the scandal of their neighbors and substitute a new antagonist for the original one. (loc 529)</p>

<p>Satan is the master of the single victim mechanism, and so he is the master of human culture, whose origin is none other than this act of murder. At the origin not only of the Cainite culture but of all human cultures is ultimately the devil, namely, the bad contagion that results in violence and is expelled thanks to the unanimous misinterpretation of the founding murder. (loc 1466)</p>

<p>Satan sows the scandals and reaps the whirlwind of mimetic crises. It is his opportunity to show what he is capable of doing. The great crises lead us to the true mystery of Satan, to his astonishing power, which is that of expelling himself and bringing order back into human communities. (loc 694)</p>

<p>&quot;How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand. […]</p>
<p>Jesus does not deny the reality of Satan&#39;s self-expulsion; he asserts it. (loc 702)</p>
<p><em>This is a strange reading of Matthew 12:26. I thought it was about Jesus explaining that he cannot be Satan BECAUSE he is able to expel Satan.</em></p>

<p>Because of this extraordinary power, Satan is the prince of this world. If he could not protect his domain from the violence that threatens to destroy it, even though it is essentially his own, he would not merit this title of prince, which the Gospels do not award him lightly. If he were purely a destroyer, Satan would have lost his domain long ago. To understand why he is the master of all the kingdoms of this world, we must take Jesus at his word: disorder expels disorder, or in other words Satan really expels Satan. By executing this extraordinary feat, he has been able to make himself indispensable, and so his power remains great. (loc 713)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To identify Satan as mimetic violence completes the process of discrediting the prince of this world; it puts the finishing touch on Gospel demystification; it contributes to that &quot;fall of Satan&quot; that Jesus announces before his crucifixion. (loc 2897)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In all the titles and functions attributed to Satan, we see re-appearing all the symptoms of desire and its sickness, the evolution of which Jesus diagnoses. These titles and functions include the &quot;tempter,&quot; the &quot;accuser,&quot; the &quot;prince of this world,&quot; the &quot;prince of darkness,&quot; the &quot;murderer from the beginning,&quot; and all of them together explain why Satan is the concealed producer, director of the Passion. This dynamic concept of Satan enables the Gospels to articulate the founding paradox of archaic societies. They exist only by virtue of the sickness that should prevent their existence. In its acute crises the sickness of desire generates its own antidote, the violent and pacifying unanimity of the scapegoat. The pacifying effects of this violence continue in the ritual systems that stabilize human communities. All of this is epitomized in the statement &quot;Satan expels Satan.&quot; The Gospel theory of Satan uncovers a secret that neither ancient nor modern anthropologies have ever discovered. Violence in archaic religion is a temporary remedy. The sickness is not really cured and always recurs in the end. (loc 2889)</p>

<p>In short, we integrate the central concern of Judaism and Christianity into our systems of self-defense. Instead of criticizing ourselves, we use our knowledge in bad faith, turning it against others. Indeed, we practice a hunt for scapegoats to the second degree, a hunt for hunters of scapegoats. Our society&#39;s obligatory compassion authorizes new forms of cruelty. (loc 2508)</p>

<p>Since lynching a victim with bare hands plays a significant role in ancient myths, why not try out the simplest hypothesis, the most logical one: behind the myths is real violence analogous in savage ferocity to the stoning at Ephesus? Mimetic conflicts are real, leading regularly to collective violence, so why not suppose that there is real violence behind most of the myths? If the lynchers tear apart their victim with their own hands, they must be without weapons. If they had weapons, they would use them. If they don&#39;t have them, it&#39;s because they didn&#39;t think they needed them. They had come together for peaceful reasons, to welcome a visitor perhaps, and suddenly things went wrong... (loc 1122)</p>

<p>To make this description of the monster more respectable, Philostratus has him vomit foaming saliva &quot;like rabid dogs,&quot; but this transformation is scarcely impressive or convincing; it is too transparent to conceal the sad truth. Here we have only a pale form of myth. The unanimous murder is not transformed sufficiently to be divinized. This is why a new deity does not appear. We know what this stoning lacks to produce a god: a sufficiently powerful event of collective violence. If the collective violence were more powerful, the beggar would be divinized. (loc 1158)</p>

<p>[John the Baptist]</p>
<p>In both cases everything stems from a mimetic crisis. Concerning the prophet, it is the crisis of the marriage of Herod to Herodias. John reproaches Herod for his illegal marriage to the wife of his brother; Herodias desires revenge but Herod protects John. To force his hand, at his birthday banquet Herodias stirs up the crowd of guests against her enemy. To whip up the mimetic contagion of this gathering and transform it into a bloody pack, Herodias resorts to the art that the Greeks took to be the most mimetic of all, the most apt at a sacrifice to motivate participants against the victim: dancing. Herodias has her own daughter dance. The dancer, manipulated by her mother, requests John&#39;s head as a reward, and the guests unanimously demand the head of John. (loc 600)</p>

<p>we will compare a great biblical account, the story of Joseph, to the most well-known myth of all, the story of King Oedipus. The results will facilitate our access to the essential problem, the divinity of Jesus Christ in the Christian religion. (loc 1743)</p>
<p>Just like Oedipus, in short, Joseph barely escapes death and is expelled from his own family. […] In both instances a community gathers unanimously against one of its members and violently expels him. […]</p>
<p>The myth and the biblical story are in basic opposition over the decisive question that collective violence poses: Is it warranted? Is it legitimate? In the myth the expulsions of the hero are justified each time. In the biblical account they never are. Collective violence is unjustifiable. (loc 1770)</p>

<p>Thank God for the historians of the Middle Ages! They refuse to deny the reality of witch-hunts.

<p>Bloody sacrifices are attempts to repress or moderate the internal conflicts of primitive or archaic communities, and they do this by reproducing as exactly as possible, at the expense of the victims substituted for the original victim, a real act of violence that had occurred in the indeterminate past. This original violence had really reconciled these communities, thanks to its unanimity, The gods are always involved in the sacrifices because the collective acts of violence the sacrifices intend to reproduce are the same ones that, at some point in the past, had spontaneously reconciled these communities (loc 1331)</p>

<p>We should envisage the possibility that all human institutions, and therefore humanity itself, are rooted in sacrifice. Indeed, to escape from animal instinct and arrive at mimetic desire with all its dangers of mimetic conflicts, humans have to discipline their desire, and they cannot accomplish that except by means of sacrifices (loc 1556)</p>

<p>The exasperation of mimetic rivalries would have prevented human societies from forming if it had not produced its own remedy at its very height. This remedy is the single victim, or scapegoat, mechanism. Surviving in our culture in only very attenuated forms, this mechanism must have reconciled the earliest communities and given them first a ritual order and then an institutional order, which assured the community&#39;s temporal duration and a relative stability. Yes, indeed, human societies must be the daughters of religion. (loc 1579)</p>

<p>Why do certain cultures bury their victims under heaps of stones that they often shape into a pyramid form? We can explain this custom as a by-product of ritual stonings. When a victim is stoned, the body is covered with stones. When the attackers throw a lot of stones at someone still alive, not only does the victim die, but the stones naturally take the partially conic form of a &quot;barrow&quot; or mound. We find just this, put more or less into geometrical form, in the sacrificial or funerary pyramids of various peoples, beginning with the Egyptians. (loc 1534)</p>

<p>Before placing too much confidence in Nietzsche, our era should have meditated on one of the most sharp and brilliant sayings of Heraclitus: &quot;Dionysos is the same thing as Hades.&quot; Dionysos, in other words, is the same thing as hell, the same thing as Satan, the same thing as death, the same thing as the lynch mob.

<p>A typical example in the Gospel of John is the way Jesus, soon to be crucified, cites a very simple saying, &quot;They hated me without cause&quot; (John 15:25; cf. Ps. 35:19). It appears banal at first, but this sentence expresses the essential nature of the hostility against the victim. (loc 2048)</p>

<p>At the end of his account of the Passion Luke adds this observation: &quot;And that same day Herod and Pilate became friends, for before this they had been enemies&quot; (23:12). According to the Gospel of Luke Jesus appeared briefly before Herod. And it is their common participation in the death of Jesus that brings Herod and Pilate together. Their reconciliation is one of those cathartic effects that benefit the participants in a collective murder, the unrepentant persecutors. It is the most characteristic effect of these murders. If it is powerful enough, it leads to the mythic deification of the victim. (loc 2118)</p>

<p>By nailing Christ to the Cross, the powers believed they were doing what they ordinarily did in unleashing the single victim mechanism. They thought they were avoiding the danger of disclosure.

<p>It is mimetic contagion that completely determines the contents of mythology. The myths are so much in its thrall that they can-not suspect their own subjection. No text can make allusion to the principle of illusion that governs it. (loc 2336)</p>

<p>In the Gospel of Luke Christ sees Satan &quot;fall like lightning from heaven&quot; (10:18). Evidently he falls to earth, and he will not re-main inactive. Jesus does not announce the immediate end of Satan, not yet at least. (loc 2933)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>on the third day of the Passion the scattered disciples re-group again about Jesus, who they believe is risen from the dead. Something happens in extremis that never happens in myths. A protesting minority appears and resolutely rises up against the unanimity of the persecuting crowd. […].</p>
<p>Where did they suddenly find the strength to oppose the crowd and the Jerusalem authorities? How do we explain this turnabout so contrary to all we have learned of the irresistible power of mimetic escalation? Until now I have always been able to find plausible responses to the questions posed in this book within a purely commonsensical and &quot;anthropological&quot; context. This time, however, it is impossible. […] The Gospels respond that it is the Spirit of God, the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. (loc 2998)</p>

<p>In the Gospel of John the name given to this Spirit admirably describes the power that tears the disciples away from this all-powerful contagion: the Paraclete. I have commented on this term in other essays, but its importance for what I am doing in this book is so great that I must return to it. The principal meaning of pacrakletos is &quot;lawyer for the defense,&quot; &quot;defender of the accused.&quot; (loc 3001)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Nietzsche</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Hitler&#39;s genocide flagrantly contradicts the thesis argued in the preceding chapter that the Western world, and now effectively the entire planet, is dominated by the concern for victims. (loc 2702)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Nietzsche was the first philosopher to understand that the collective violence of myths and rituals (everything he named &quot;Dionysos&quot;) is of the same type as the violence of the Passion.</p>
<p>(loc 2710)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Nietzsche, to discredit the Jewish-Christian revelation, tries to show that its commitment to the side of victims stems from a paltry, miserable resentment. Observing that the earliest Christians belonged primarily to the lower classes, he accuses them of sympathizing with victims so as to satisfy their resentment of the pagan aristocrats. This is the famous &quot;slave morality.&quot; (loc 2734)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Since Nietzsche is blind to mimetic rivalry and its contagion, he doesn&#39;t see that the Gospel stance toward victims does not come from prejudice in favor of the weak against the strong but is heroic resistance to violent contagion. (loc 2740)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it is not by accident, in my view, that the explicit discovery of what Dionysos and the Crucified have in common and what separates them occurs so shortly before his final breakdown. Nietzsche&#39;s devotees try to empty his insanity of all meaning. We can understand perfectly why. The nonsense of madness plays a protective role in their thought just as madness itself functions for Nietzsche. Nietzsche the philosopher was unable to sit back comfortably in the monstrosities into which the need to minimize his discovery was driving him. And so he took refuge in madness. (loc 2745)</p>
<p><em>Pretty based to claim that Nietzsche went mad in discovering one of the tenets of Girard’s thesis</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Nietzsche is the author of the only texts capable of clarifying the Nazi horror. If there is a spiritual essence of the movement, Nietzsche is the one who expresses it. (loc 2775)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Since the Holocaust, however, it is no longer possible to blame Jews. The intellectuals and other cultural elites have promoted Christianity to the role of number one scapegoat. Everyone goes into ecstasy over the airy, wholesome, athletic character of Greek civilization, as against the supposedly closed, suspicious, dull, and repressive atmosphere of the Jewish and Christian world. (loc 2834)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The most powerful anti-Christian movement is the one that takes over and &quot;radicalizes&quot; the concern for victims in order to paganize it. The powers and principalities want to be &quot;revolutionary&quot; now, and they reproach Christianity for not defending victims with enough ardor. In Christian history they see nothing but persecutions, acts of oppression, inquisitions. (loc 2850)</p>
<p><em>See Girard’s lectures on wokeness and cancel culture. Cancel culture is another way for the mob to pursue its bloodlust.</em></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bad situations tend to be Nash Equilibria]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has become somewhat fashionable among the intelligentsia to proudly proclaim &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; to many questions, flaunting their avoidance of Dunning-Kruger overconfidence. Yudkowsky calls this the &quot;modest epistemology&quot; – the philosophy that in most situations, you shouldn&#39;t believe that you know better than consensus. <em>Inadequate Equilibria</em> is a book that aims to explore whether this has been taken too far. When should we feel comfortable claiming that we know better than consensus?</p>
<p>This is a deep topic. It is relevant to investing, entrepreneurship, political views, healthcare. When is it rational to criticise the policy of the government? When (if ever) should you ignore your doctor? When should you try to build a solution to a problem?</p>
<p>To answer this question, Yudkowsky seeks to understand which areas of the world are &quot;efficient&quot; (in the efficient market sense), wherein individual participants are incentivised to form the best possible solution. In general, for systems like this, you should have a strong prior belief that you will not outperform consensus. However, few systems are as efficient as financial markets (and even markets are only efficient to a degree). But efficiency does not immediately mean that you can beat consensus, which leads us to the second core theme of the book: exploitability.</p>
<p>It is a common occurrence in game theory that a particular game will have several Nash equilibrium, but that these Nash equilibria may not be equally “good”. Prisoners Dilemma is not actually one of these games, since the strictly dominant strategy and sole Nash Equilibrium is to defect, but an example could be putting your money in banks: if everybody else puts their money in a bank, you should do the same (and earn interest). If people want to withdraw their money en masse, you should do the same, otherwise you may lose your money due to a run on the bank. So there are two equilibria here, except the former is clearly better for everyone, and the latter is <strong>inadequate</strong>. The problem is that the &quot;bad situation&quot; has everyone playing their best move in response to others&#39; best moves (this is the definition of a Nash equilibrium), so these situations are hard to change even if nobody is happy. There are plenty of great examples of this: the book discusses the US healthcare system at length – it&#39;s a broken system, but unfortunately seems to be at an inadequate Nash equilibrium. Or, as Yud surmises: “usually, when things suck, it’s because they suck in a way that’s a Nash equilibrium”.</p>
<p>The book contains immensely important ideas, but can be rather too “intellectual” at times – the content is highly abstract and the author uses lots of rationalist jargon. Furthermore, while I think I superficially understand the relationship between the modest epistemology and inadequate equilibria, the topics don&#39;t seem to me to be as fundamentally intertwined as Yudkowsky thinks, though on this point I defer to his intellect and assume that it&#39;s because I&#39;m missing the point.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you ever find yourself thinking &quot;this is a bad system for everybody, why can&#39;t we change it&quot;, the book might shed some light on the realities of the inadequate equilibria that surround us.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Market efficiency</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>If I had to name the single epistemic feat at which modern human civilization is most adequate, the peak of all human power of estimation, I would unhesitatingly reply, “Short-term relative pricing of liquid financial assets, like the price of S&amp;P 500 stocks relative to other S&amp;P 500 stocks over the next three months.” This is something into which human civilization puts an actual effort. (loc 141)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Theoretically, a liquid market should be just exploitable enough to pay competent professionals the same hourly rate as their next-best opportunity. (loc 161)</p>
<p><em>This is formalised in</em> <em><a href="/?books=efficiently-inefficient" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Efficiently Inefficient</a></em> **</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What people hear when you talk about “efficient prices” is that a cold-blooded machine has determined that some people ought to be paid $9/hour. And they hear the economist saying nice things about the machine, praising it as “efficient,” implying that the machine is right about this $9/hour price being good for society, (loc 337)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A market that knows everything you know is a market where prices are “efficient” in the conventional economic sense—one where you can’t predict the net direction in which the price will change. This means that the efficiency of a market is assessed relative to your own intelligence, which is fine. Indeed, it’s possible that the concept should be called “relative efficiency.” (loc 349)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Today’s markets may not be efficient relative to the smartest hedge fund managers, or efficient relative to corporate insiders with secret knowledge that hasn’t yet leaked. But the stock markets are efficient relative to you, and to me, (loc 354)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you want to outperform—if you want to do anything not usually done—then you’ll need to conceptually divide our civilization into areas of lower and greater competency. My view is that this is best done from a framework of incentives and the equilibria of those incentives—which is to say, from the standpoint of microeconomics. (loc 272)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Exploitability</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The startup equity market was inefficient (a price underwent a predictable decline), but it wasn’t exploitable. (loc 364)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We can see the notion of an inexploitable market as generalizing the notion of an efficient market as follows: in both cases, there’s no free energy inside the system. In both markets, there’s a horde of hungry organisms moving around trying to eat up all the free energy. (loc 391)</p>

<p>Efficiency: “Microsoft’s stock price is neither too low nor too high, relative to anything you can possibly know about Microsoft’s stock price.”</p>
<p>Inexploitability: “Some houses and housing markets are overpriced, but you can’t make a profit by short-selling them, and you’re unlikely to find any substantially underpriced houses—the market as a whole isn’t rational, but it contains participants who have money and understand housing markets as well as you do.”</p>
<p>Adequacy: “Okay, the medical sector is a wildly crazy place where different interventions have orders-of-magnitude differences in cost-effectiveness, but at least there’s no well-known but unused way to save ten thousand lives for just ten dollars each, right? Somebody would have picked up on it! Right?!” (loc 434)</p>

<p>usually, when things suck, it’s because they suck in a way that’s a Nash equilibrium. (loc 494)</p>

<p>In a system like academia, the competition for free energy may not correspond to anything good from your own standpoint, and as a result you may label the outcome “inadequate”; but there is still no free energy. (loc 523)</p>

<p>there’s usually a deeper reason than “nobody thought of it.” (loc 583)</p>
<p><em>See also Chesterton’s fence.</em></p>

<p>I shall, somewhat arbitrarily, sort these concepts into three larger categories:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Decisionmakers who are not beneficiaries</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Asymmetric information</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Nash equilibria that aren’t even the best Nash equilibrium, let alone Pareto-optimal.<br>In other words:</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Cases where the decision lies in the hands of people who would gain little personally, or lose out personally, if they did what was necessary to help someone else;</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Cases where decision-makers can’t reliably learn the information they need to make decisions, even though someone else has that information;</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Systems that are broken in multiple places so that no one actor can make them better, even though, in principle, some magically coordinated action could move to a new stable state. (loc 693)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Universities pay attention to prestigious journals because of a signaling equilibrium, which, in our taxonomy, is a kind of bad Nash equilibrium that no single actor can defy unilaterally. In your terms, it involves a sticky, stable equilibrium of everyone acting insane in a way that’s secretly a sane response to everyone else acting insane. (loc 873)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>on a larger scale, what we’re seeing is an extra stickiness that results when the incentive to try an innovation requires you to believe that other people will believe the innovation will work. An equilibrium like that can be much stickier than a scenario where, if you believe that a project will succeed, you have an incentive to try it even if other people expect the project to fail. (loc 1223)</p>
<p><em>Systems are harder to improve when they rely on collective belief in the improvement, because there is a kind of bootstrapping problem.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In reality, the multi-stage nature of venture capital makes it very easy for the field to end up pinned to traditions about whether entrepreneurs ought to have red hair—not because everyone believes it, but because everyone believes that everyone believes it. (loc 1227)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Nash equilibrium isn’t an illusion. Individuals would do worse by playing away from that Nash equilibrium. Wasted votes are wasted. The current system is an effective trap and the voters are trapped. They can’t just wish their way out of that trap. (loc 1302)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Every possible dysfunction is competing against every other possible dysfunction to explain the observed data. Sloppy cynicism will usually be wrong, (loc 1623)</p>

<p>I worry, however, that many people end up misusing and overapplying the “outside view” concept very soon after they learn about it, and that a lot of people tie too much of their mental conception of what good reasoning looks like to the stereotype of the humble empiricist fox. (loc 1931)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the message of “distrust theorizing” had become so strong that Founder 1 had stopped trying to model users in detail and thought it was futile to make an advance prediction. (loc 1985)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>reference class tennis—both parties get stuck insisting that their own “outside view” is the correct one, based on diverging intuitions about what similarities are relevant. (loc 2073)</p>

<p>the essence of rationality is to adapt to whatever world you find yourself in, rather than to be “humble” or “arrogant” a priori. (loc 2344)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>overcompensation after being warned about a cognitive bias is also a recognized problem in the literature; (loc 2382)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Try to make sure you’d arrive at different beliefs in different worlds.” You don’t want to think in such a way that you wouldn’t believe in a conclusion in a world where it were true, just because a fallacious argument could support it. (loc 2529)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Finally, consider appeals to [Aumann] agreement. As a matter of probability theory, perfect rationality plus mutual understanding often entails perfect agreement. Yet it doesn’t follow from this that the way for human beings to become more rational is to try their best to minimize disagreement […]</p>
<p>Whether applied selectively or consistently, the temptation of modesty is to “fake” Aumann agreement—to rush the process, rather than waiting until you and others can actually rationally converge upon the same views. The temptation is to call an early halt to risky lines of inquiry, to not claim to know too much, and to not claim to aspire to too much; all while wielding a fully general argument against anyone who doesn’t do the same. (loc 2607)</p>
<p><em>Aumann Agreement can be abused to enforce agreement quickly</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>if you’re trying to do something unusually well (a common enough goal for ambitious scientists, entrepreneurs, and effective altruists), then this will often mean that you need to seek out the most neglected problems. You’ll have to make use of information that isn’t widely known or accepted, and pass into relatively uncharted waters. And modesty is especially detrimental for that kind of work, because it discourages acting on private information, making less-than-certain bets, and breaking new ground. (loc 2688)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Any biography of Frank Ramsey must start with, and be haunted by, his death”.</p>
<p>Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, has a life span but one tenth that of our sun; it’s a somewhat poetic principle in astronomy that the most luminous stars burn out the fastest. This cosmic principle seems to be mirrored in human experience. Alexander the Great, who conquered vast territories and redefined the ancient world, died at the age of 32. In music: Otis Redding at 25, Buddy Holly at 22, Tupac at 25. The arts have seen similar losses, with Jean-Michel Basquiat passing at 27 and Egon Schiele at 28. In mathematics, one is reminded of the 32 years life of that strange genius Ramanujan (chronicled in <em>The Man Who Knew Infinity</em> ), to whom the Hindu goddess Namagiri whispered mathematical truth.</p>
<p>Yet in one of those tragic oversights of history, Frank Ramsey is seldom counted in such company. That a mind so fine, a heart so gentle, and someone so deeply <em>human</em> should perish at the age of 26, just when he was fully coming into his powers… puts a blanket of melancholy on the reader that is hard to shake off even after finishing the book.</p>
<p>Ramsey was a precocious youth, though not a child prodigy, who developed a voracious reading appetite at Winchester, before matriculating at Trinity College Cambridge in 1920, aged 17. At 19, while still an undergraduate, he translated Wittgenstein’s notoriously recondite <em>Tractactus</em> from German into English, and delivered a deep critique of Keynes’ <em>Treatise on Probability</em> which rattled Keynes and largely convinced the intellectual public that Keynes was incorrect. Notably, none of these side activities got in the way of Ramsey graduating as the Senior Wrangler at the age of 20. He became a fellow at King’s College shortly after, and was perhaps the only mind that could go head-to-head with Wittgenstein, Keynes, Moore, and Russell, each in their respective fields of expertise. All this while raising a family and being an active participant in the polygamous and free-thinking Bloomsbury Circle.</p>
<p>Ramsey’s contributions are hard to understate. The general pattern is that he brought a fierce creativity to each of the fields that he graced with his presence; his work was often decades ahead of its time, and formed subfields that created rich areas of future study.</p>
<p>In mathematics, we have Ramsey Theory, one famous result being that at any party with six people, there will be at least three mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. In probability, Ramsey developed subjective Bayesianism (commonly attributed to Bruno de Finetti rather than Ramsey), which treats probability as subjective degrees of belief that can be measured by considering betting odds. In philosophy, Ramsey wrestled with some of the hard problems of Truth and Belief, not to mention his role in translating, interpreting, and challenging Wittgenstein. Indeed, Misak believes that Ramsey’s death may have been a catalyst in creating the Later Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Economics was something of a side hobby for Ramsey – he would dip into it briefly when life got too busy for him to do proper mathematics or philosophy. These sojourns were enormously productive! His papers on optimal taxation and optimal saving sparked the creation of two important subfields that have undoubtedly influenced economic policy. These papers, which Ramsey was initially reluctant to publish because he felt were too simple, were both selected by the <em>Economic Journal</em> in their 125th anniversary edition – “one of the world’s best journals of economics decided that two of its thirteen most important papers were written by Frank Ramsey when he was twenty-five years old”. Misak puts it well: “he roamed freely over philosophy, mathematics, logic, probability theory, and economics. Perhaps no one would ever again do so with such intelligence and skill”.</p>
<p>Ramsey’s intellect is undeniable, but I am moved more by his humanism. Eulogies wax lyrical about the graciousness of his character, his warm laughter, and his genuine interest in people. Unlike Wittgenstein, Ramsey was not a philosopher in an ivory tower, gnawing deeply on abstract problems and needing to be seen as the deepest thinker on a topic. He respected common sense, and much of his thinking was ultimately directed at the betterment of society. One gets the feeling that had he lived longer, Ramsey would have been a resounding force for humanism in the 20th century.</p>
<p>This is the rare biography whose standalone merits I can confidently articulate, even setting aside my admiration for its subject. Drawing from new primary sources, Misak critiques some of the existing narratives around Ramsey, hinting that the jealousy of his contemporaries played a part in the shaping of his legacy. The brief expositions of technicals concepts, provided by relevant experts, give a glimpse of the intellectual mountains that Ramsey scaled. Misak also indulges the reader with “what if” speculations – a particularly tragic one being “the most spectacular near-miss in the foundations of mathematics”, involving Ramsey and Alan Turing. Both became King’s College fellows at 22, shared an interest in the foundations of mathematics (and in fact lectured the same course), and both shared untimely fates. Had Ramsey not died a year before Turing matriculated, he would have undoubtedly been Turing’s supervisor at King’s. What heights could they have achieved together? Would Ramsey’s contributions have changed the course of the war? And what about Turing’s subsequent post-war research into computing? While such counterfactual speculations may never amount to anything, they do inspire somber reflection on the potentiality of life.</p>
<p>How does history choose who to lay its eyes on? Ramsey was certainly in the “room where it happened”, but perhaps by being shoulder-to-shoulder with giants like Keynes, Wittgenstein, and Russell, he graciously consigned himself to the sidelines of history. Or was it the fact that Ramsey was so far ahead of his time? Philosopher Donald Davidson coined &quot;the Ramsey Effect&quot; to describe the realisation that one’s splendid new philosophical discovery already existed within Ramsey&#39;s body of work. In either case, Misak has made a valuable contribution to the history of philosophy, deftly weaving together Ramsey’s ideas, personal relationships, and the intellectual milieu in which he shone so brightly, but all too briefly.</p>

<p>Certainly, that young man was a true product of Cambridge at its best – nobody can have any doubt about it who ever met him […]. In discussion he impressed one curiously like an overgrown two-year-old who misbehaves on the race-course from sheer excess of powers (p. xxiv)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One of the ways in which Ramsey was so special – and radical – was that he saw it as a mark of good theory that it be “realistic” or able to make a difference in practice. […] Ramsey dispensed with myth and metaphor and instead placed human beings – ‘finite, fallible, and yet extraordinarily functional’ – at the heart of his theories. (p. xxvi)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>he would become the singular mind who could engage each of those great thinkers – Keynes, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein – on their own terms. There would be simply no one else who could do that, including these four themselves. (p. 54)</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>“Where I seem to differ from some of my friends is in attaching little importance to physical size. I don&#39;t feel the least humble before the vastness of the heavens. The stars may be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does. I take no credit for weighing nearly seventeen stone.</p>
<p>My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits. I don&#39;t really believe in astronomy, except as a complicated description of part of the course of human and possibly animal sensation. I apply my perspective not merely to space but also to time. In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing. Nor is the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place.</p>
<p>You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me. But I have reason and you have none; you would only have a reason for despising me if your feeling corresponded to the fact in a way mine didn&#39;t. But neither can correspond to the fact. The fact is not in itself good or bad; it is just that it thrills me but depresses you. On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one&#39;s activities.” (p. 218)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Human beings do not work the way ideal utilitarian theory has it, nor is there any value in trying to identity rationality with ‘the opinion of an ideal person in similar circumstances’. To be sure, ‘the highest ideal would be always to have a true opinion and be certain of it’; but ‘this ideal is more suited to God than to man’. And Ramsey did not think that God existed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are possibility incarnate]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A Simple Guide to Being and Time</em> has the admirable goal of making Heidegger digestible. It is hard to say whether the author succeeds here, since even Foulds’ “simple” treatment is fairly recondite. My subjective experience of reading this is similar to what I imagine mud wrestling must be like – just when I think I have a grasp of the ideas, I slip and suddenly find myself pinned face down in an intellectual quagmire. Concepts aren’t introduced linearly, and Foulds often uses precise language in precisely different ways. I truly don’t think he is to blame for this – uniquely among introductory Heidegger commentators, he really does try to engage with the nuance and complexity inherent to <em>Being and Time</em> . In any case, since I first dipped into the <em>Simple Guide</em> a few months ago, Heidegger’s thought has embedded itself in my thinking, so regardless of whether this is a good or bad book (I lack the experience to pass judgment), I have derived an enormous amount of value from it.</p>
<p>Now let me preface any further discussion with two disclaimers and a housekeeping note. Firstly, I think it is hard to discuss Heidegger without sounding like a snob. Secondly, Heidegger is not straightforward, and there is likely a hefty amount of Dunning-Kruger in this review. Please grant me some indulgence, therefore. Housekeeping: all Heidegger-specific technical terminology is italicised in its first use.</p>
<p>Heidegger’s project is to understand Being-with-a-capital-B. If that doesn’t make sense to you, you’re in good company, for Heidegger believes that none of the philosophers of the prior two millennia had adequately considered that question. Instead, they had been exploring what human beings are (ontology, philosophy of mind), how they should behave (ethics), and how they can know things (epistemology). Each of these avenues essentially treats humans as things to be deconstructed, without trying to understand human <em>Being</em> . The Continental tradition makes some progress, but even the phenomenology of Husserl (Heidegger’s mentor) dances around the question of what human Being is – by “bracketing” out the real world to understand subjective impressions, Husserl is still saying “there is this thing I call me; what is the precise nature of the impressions being made on this thing”. Heidegger is trying to deeply understand what it means to Be, and in particular, what human Being means.</p>
<p>The core concept of <em>Being and Time</em> is <em>Dasein</em> (translated as ”there-being” or “being-there”). Dasein is the type of Being that humans are. What makes Dasein special is that we engage with the world in terms of different possibilities for existence (we are ”Possibility Incarnate”), and we are able to understand (<em>disclose</em> ) the Being of other objects and ourselves. A stick does not inherently have possibilities for existence – those possibilities are imbued on it by humans using it to achieve different possibilities in our existence: playing fetch with a dog, using it as a walking stick, using it as a weapon. Heidegger rejects the dualist notion that we are some soul inhabiting a physical world; instead, he conceives of <em>being-in-the-world</em> as something inseparable from Dasein. We cannot help but be-in-the-world*–* we need a world in which to manifest possibility, and we give meaning to the world.</p>
<p>This sounds rather motivational, but sadly, most humans exist <em>inauthentically</em> . We forget our deep <em>potentiality-for-being</em> , and often let society (<em>Das Man</em>, “them”) dictate how we should behave. We do this because it kinda sucks to have to deal with the ever-present potentiality-for-being! It causes <em>anxiety</em> to have to choose between different modes of existing, one at the expense of others, so we would rather let Das Man <em>tranquillise</em> into a state of<em>internalised averageness</em> . Authenticity requires <em>resoluteness</em> in the face of existential anxiety – fully recognising our potentiality-for-being, and ignoring the lulling siren song of Das Man.</p>
<p>It’s not lost on me that this may sound like the soundbites one hears on motivational TikToks. Live life to the fullest! Have high agency and choose how you want to live! Don’t listen to society! Heidegger would probably argue that these people are still not authentically experiencing the anxiety of being possibility incarnate – in fact, Heidegger explicitly calls out this perpetual fascination with “self-discovery” as inauthentic (he calls it <em>self-entanglement</em> ), because by trying to discover yourself, you are still attempting to understand your being as a “thing-ish” object rather than potentiality-for-being.</p>
<p>There is this idea, forwarded by various Heidegger scholars as well as this author, that when Heidegger uses words like authentic and inauthentic, he is not making value judgments – he is simply seeking to understand Being. Inauthenticity is only problematic to the extent that it obscures being, which is his particular project. The natural state of <em>falling</em> into <em>idle chatter</em> and being tranquillised by Das Man isn’t morally wrong, it’s just the way we are.</p>
<p>I choose to disagree. I am possibility incarnate, and Heidegger’s philosophy itself is something <em>ready-at-hand</em> , onto which I can <em>project</em> my potentiality-for-being. I shall do this by interpreting his philosophy normatively – I should want to understand Being and think for myself rather than blindly adopting the will of Das Man. I should live resolutely and gracefully accept the anxiety that comes with infinite possibility. I should treat every passing second as the “moment of vision” (Kierkegaard), an opportunity to carry forward my past values and project my potentiality onto the world.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Existence is thus a way of relating to possibilities, some of which must be chosen at the expense of others.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Even for Dasein itself, there are different possibilities: Dasein can be authentic and inauthentic (these are existentialia of Dasein)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Disclosing the Being of other entities – understanding how they fit into the world and how they interact with various possibilities for human existence – also discloses the Being of Dasein.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><strong>Categorial</strong> vs Existential analysis:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Categorial analysis is thing-ish, e.g. categorising people physically treats them as things. Existential analysis involves looking at the different ways a person can exist.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Existentialia are classes of existential possibility: the possibility of Being honest is an existentiale, because persons can choose to exist in an honest way or a dishonest way</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Existentiell features are specific to a particular individual’s existence: the fact that I am honest or dishonest is an existentiell fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">**Care **as the Being of Dasein:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Care is the idea that various facts/objects/persons interact with your various possibilities for existing and thus have varying degrees of importance for your Being.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">**Being-in-the-world **(a key aspect of Dasein)<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">You need a world in which to Be a person – some framework with which possibilities can be chosen. “Matter, energy, space and time constitute a world only because persons exist in them, and persons can exist in them only because they constitute a world.”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">We Care about the Being of objects in the world because they relate to various possibilities for our existence.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Being-in-the-world does not meant that we are a human “thing” that is placed in the world. It is a way of engaging with the world, much like “being in love”, and in particular, engaging with the possibilities. Rejects Cartesian dualism: being-in-the-world is something that humans just do. There is not some physical body and eternal soul.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Understanding: the immediate/practical disclosure of objects as possible equipment. Understanding can be demonstrated by using something.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Interpretation: the disclosure of objects as ready-at-hand, e.g. sighting that a door’s Being is in-order-to control access.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“Ready-at-hand” entities are relevant to your particular existentiell, either as a help or hindrance.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Traditional philosophy has treated all entities, including themselves, as present-at-hand, rather than engaging with them as contributions to possibilities.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“Being-towards” is an aspect of Dasein in which persons are oriented towards ready-at-hand objects</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Circumspection: on the lookout for entities that are ready-at-hand, e.g. a fishernamn is circumspective about the weather, sensitive to weather it will serve or threaten their chosen possibility for existence. We “sight” an object when we <em>see it as</em> something relevant for our possibilities.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Reflection is a deficient mode of Dasein, in which you dis-engage and try to consider objects “objectively” as present-at-hand. Reflection does not disclose Being.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Thrownness: at any moment you find yourself with a particular circumstance, physical constitution, mental constitution.<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Moods / state of mind: disclose how you have experienced being-in-the-world so far. e.g. if a mood makes you “turn away” from a fact, it discloses your thrownness as distasteful, threatening.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Facticity is your actuality as an already-defined being that gets thrown into the world. It is centred on the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Das man (”They”):<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Das man is the set of communal values and norms, the “everyone” in “everyone knows this”.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Distantiality is how closely you fit into a “they” – the more closely, the more “averageness” you have (in that your existence becomes more interchangeable with the community).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Publicness: internalised averageness, when the set of Das Man’s assumptions dominate your existence (in ways you may not be aware of). Normal humans experience publicness and often act as a “they-self”.</li>

<p>Being a person, however, is something that humans do; it&#39;s a way of relating to the world understandingly. In Being and Time Heidegger interrogates the activity of being a person [there-being/dasein] because only that activity discloses Being (using a hammer as a hammer, for instance, discloses the Being of the hammer, and the Being of a person, in a way that seeing, touching, hearing, smelling or taking it apart does not). (loc 68)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There-being [being a person] is an activity over time that involves engaging with the world in terms of possibilities for existing in different ways - as a builder, teacher, criminal, layabout, patriot, farmer, or whatever. Because these possibilities are open to you, and you have to constantly be choosing at least one at the expense of others, you care about them and who you are being is a issue for you. The way you act over time, as a potentiality to whom possibilities in the world matter, discloses there-being (loc 88)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The essence of any entity is that without which it could not be the entity it is. The essence of things is a set of material or conceptual structures. The essence of being a person, however, is a way of relating to possibilities from among which you choose some at the expense of others. This way of relating to the world is existence. (loc 127)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Dissecting anything doesn&#39;t disclose its Being so much obscure it (close it off). Even something as simple as a hammer loses its Being as a hammer (its character as a tool for banging things) if you dissect it into a head and a handle. (loc 102)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The traditional picture of a person as some kind of soul, consciousness or other thing-like essence, obscures the truth that (1) you need a world in which to be a person, (2) a particular way of being in the world is essential to being a person, and (3) the Being of the world, its components, and yourself, is an issue for you. (loc 111)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That persons are potentialities-for-being, who need ongoing possibilities to actualise simply to exist as persons, is one of the key insights of Being and Time. This insight matters particularly because humans chronically misdefine their Being as persons in terms of actualities - who you are is thought to be fixed by your biological or &#39;spiritual&#39; constitution, race, gender, star sign, career, social class, or whatever. (loc 187)</p>
<p><em>Those are categorial, rather than existential comments.</em></p>

<p>Having to choose an existence is why you Care. Knowledge arises from [is founded on] caring about your existence, so knowledge about the world is not your founding mode of being a person in the world - Care is. (loc 270)</p>

<p>You disclose meaning of entities in the world by projecting your potentiality-for-being onto them. This projection not only discloses the Being of the entity but also your own there-being as a person. (loc 1291)</div></details></p>

<p>reflection is a deficient (qv) mode of circumspection in which you dis-engage yourself from being-in the world; you, in effect, &#39;stand back&#39; and consider objects of attention as present-at-hand (loc 344)</p>

<p>If, for example, if you use a brush for painting then that use discloses its Being [its meaningful character as equipment]. But if you reflect on the brush when it is not being used for any existence-related purpose then its Being is obscured [closed off]. (loc 349)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you tend to notice the Being of objects only in a reflective state, when they are detached from their everyday Being, then what you think that you have disclosed is not, in fact, the authentic Being of the object (disclosing a brush as bristles and a handle is not the same as disclosing its Being as equipment for painting</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>you not only lose sight of their Being but also of your Being as a person who uses equipment for-the-sake-of an existence by which you realise yourself as one kind of person or another. (loc 390)</p>
<p><em>Don’t think too abstractly about things! Engage authentically with the Being of objects, because that helps disclose your Being as possibility.</em></p>

<p>sighting your lover across a crowded space brings her closer to you than people you don&#39;t care about who are actually touching you as they pass. This closeness is achieved by the way that Care de-severs you from the normal remoteness of objects. (loc 469)</p>

<p>place is where sets of related equipment belong in the arrangement of your working environment. The place for kitchen utensils, for example, is in a kitchen.

<p>self-subsistence is an activity undertaken by an entity that maintains itself as itself in a world and over time. As potentiality-for-being your self is characterised by your personality and history but cannot itself be reduced to either. (loc 506)</p>

<p>Being-with is the fact that being-one&#39;s-self always and essentially entails the influence of other persons. […]</p>
<p>Being beside, being alone, being away from, or being missing, are all derived from being-with. The only reason that you can feel alone, for example, is because being-with others is primordial and being alone is a deficient [derived] mode of being-with. (loc 526)</p>

<p>The &#39;they&#39; is not the &#39;them&#39; of an &#39;us or them&#39; dichotomy but the &#39;us&#39;; it is the abstract &#39;everyone&#39; of &quot;Everyone knows...&quot; acting as an influence. (loc 542)</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>Publicness informs your being-one&#39;s-self to such an extent that the normal human person is a they-self; that is, a self that maintains itself by being absorbed in everyday life and believing &#39;they&#39;. The they-self is still being-in-the-world but does not own its existence in an understanding of what it is to be-in-the-world authentically. We are all normally a they-self simply because we are and have to be-with the &#39;they&#39; just to get along as persons in the world. (loc 577)</p>

<p>Thrownness is the fact of finding yourself landed with the task of being someone you didn&#39;t choose to be in a geographical, social, and historical, world that you didn&#39;t choose to be-in. […]</p>
<p>You have to live with being this person at this time and place; you are the person that you are, at the time and place you are, whether you like it or not. Your mood discloses the Being of this &#39;having to&#39; as you have experienced it so far. (loc 611)</p>

<p>Potentiality-for-being contrasts with facticity - which is your actuality as an already-defined being; facticity derives from the past while potentiality is being-towards the future. Potentiality-for-being is a primordial and defining feature of being-in-the-world a person, and is the reason why there-being is always more than its present facticity. (loc 656)</p>

<p>In your average everyday mode of being a person you maintain yourself as a they-self (qv). So articulating average everydayness entails asking how the they-self exists - a task which also entails asking why humans are normally so unaware of their own Being. Heidegger answers this last question in terms of idle talk, curiosity, ambiguity, and falling. (loc 780)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Novelty-seeking [curiosity] is the restless [turbulent, qv] search for new objects of interest as a distraction from the burden of authentically being-in-the-world for ourselves. (loc 836)</p>

<p>There is no ethical implication to the term &#39;inauthentic&#39; - no suggestion that the inauthentic life is somehow inferior to an authentic one. All existence is fundamentally &#39;inauthentic&#39; [un-owner-like] because it is inevitably defined to a great extent by the culture, society, and everydayness within which it is lived. The only issue with existing &#39;inauthentically&#39; [within a community], as we all do, it that it obscures the personal aspects of there-being that Heidegger seeks. (loc 866)</p>

<p>Fallenness is the normal (inauthentic) mode of everyday existence in which persons fall into the everyday world and being-with others to the extent that we no longer sight (qv) of our being-in-the-world as potentiality-for-being. (loc 871)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Fallenness is tempting, in good part, because authentic being-in-the-world entails anxiety (qv) and the average intelligibility of being-fallen &#39;tranquillises&#39; us. Tranquillising is the way in which our being-with &#39;they&#39; replaces anxiety with confidence. &#39;They&#39; know everything; if a problem threatens then &#39;they&#39; will come up with some solution - all we have to do is wait for &#39;they&#39; to work it out and tell us what it (loc 899)</p>

<p>In self-entanglement you picture your Being as thingish and try to figure out the thing you supposedly are in order to disclose its Being. Becoming fascinated with &#39;discovering&#39; ourselves is a perennially popular diversion from the inconvenience and uncertainty of having to be-in-the-world as a potentiality. (loc 910)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Anxiety individualises you not as a specific actuality but as a specific potentiality (a &#39;no thing&#39;) that has to define an actual character for itself by existing in one way or another. This calls you to make up your mind [&#39;take a stand&#39; or be resolute, qv] about how you are going to exist rather than drifting along in everydayness. (loc 952)</p>

<p>Heidegger calls the disturbing feeling of not being &#39;at home&#39; in the world being &#39;unheimlich&#39; [&#39;un-home-like&#39;] The German unheimlich is usually translated as &#39;spooky&#39; or &#39;eerie&#39; but is rendered as &#39;uncanniness&#39; in the best extant English translation of Being and Time. Uncanniness describes how being-in-the-world feels to us when stripped of its comfortable and familiar covering. (loc 957)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Care</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Care is enacted in and as all the aspects of there-being which we have looked at so far. It is, for example, Care which explains both moods and understanding because if you didn&#39;t care then you wouldn&#39;t be affected by the world and wouldn&#39;t be motivated to understand it. Care also explains the difference between things ready-to-hand (those that immediately matter to us) and present-at-hand (those that do not immediately matter to us). (loc 966)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Care has three temporal aspects (the &#39;Care structure&#39;). Who you have been as Care (thrownness) is being-already-in (qv), who you will be as Care (projection) is being-ahead (qv), and who you are being as Care (fallenness) is being-alongside (qv). This three-part structure comes about because, for persons, caring in the present is always bound up with caring about the past and future. The tripartite temporal structure of Care is primordial to being a person because there is nothing under, behind or more primitive than Care when it comes to explaining the meaning of why persons exist as the do. If anxiety discloses your Being as Care, and Care is inescapably temporal (&#39;stretched across the future, past, and present&#39;) then anxiety shows you the essential temporality of being a person. (loc 975)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Temporality is an existential phenomenon whereby being-in-the-world as Care requires (a) ordering existence into &#39;has been&#39;, &#39;is being&#39; and &#39;will be&#39;, and (b) holding the past and future together in the present. (loc 984)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The temporal structure of Care matches the temporal structure of your there-being as mood, understanding and fallenness. Your mood is being-towards having been thrown into being-in-the-world as inherited from the past. Understanding is being-towards the future as projective. While fallenness is being-towards the everyday present. The simultaneity of these is shown in existence (loc 988)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As thrown projection, you are an integrity of actuality (the thrown) and potentiality (the projective). This integrity is temporal because who you are in the present is defined by who you have been in the past while you project your potentiality into a future by your present choices. (loc 997)</p>

<p>for persons, to whom life is the ever-present possibility of possibilities, death impends as the ever-present possibility of impossibility. […]</p>
<p>being-towards the ever-present possibility of impossibility dramatically highlights your being-towards all your existential possibilities. In other words, an authentic being-towards-death provokes an authentic being-towards existence. (loc 1092)</p>

<p>&#39;they&#39; are also a kind of oppression that doesn&#39;t allow authentic being-towards-death. Authenticity is suppressed so that the cultivation of a supposed indifference to death alienates us from our ownmost, non-relational, potentiality-for-being - we do not face death, which requires courage, but turn our faces away from it. This evasion of death is inauthentic. (loc 1115)</p>

<p>Anticipation is a response to being thrown into death, as the final end to our potentiality, in which we accept death as impending, our ownmost, non-relational and not to be outstripped. We can get a sense of what Heidegger is getting at with anticipation if we think of the way that some folk keep themselves ready to seize certain opportunities when they arise and/or make the most of their fleeting opportunities while they exist. So, far from making life pointless, authentic being-towards-death offers support for becoming intent on something. (loc 1139)</p>

<p>your conscience is experienced as a kind of call that summons you to be responsible for some aspect of your own existence. To speak of conscience as a &#39;call&#39; implies the existence of a caller - the &#39;someone&#39; who is addressing you. The call of conscience originates within you, but the caller is obviously not who you are as a they-self; after all, conscience &#39;calls&#39; against the expectations and wishes of the they-self; it &#39;speaks&#39; to you individually but tells you what you don&#39;t want to hear. […]</p>
<p>the &#39;caller&#39; in conscience is your own Being as the anxious potentiality-for-being from which you are hiding in everydayness. (loc 1169)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you take ownership of your own being-in-the-world, however, fallenness drops away and you disclose an authentic state-of-mind (readiness for anxiety), an authentic understanding (self-projection upon your own potentiality for being responsible), and an authentic discourse (reticence). Reticence is a disinclination to join in or listen to &#39;they&#39;. Where a they-self is all too willing to indulge endless idle talk, Heidegger predicts that the authentic self would be reticent [stilled by conscience]. (loc 1224)</p>

As such, it is the authentic alternative to the normally irresoluteness [turbulence, qv] of being a they-self; you make up your mind about your values, and stick to them, rather than going along with whatever is convenient and/or popular. (loc 1236)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Only by being-in-the-world authentically [resolutely] do you truly disclose your actual Situation (upper case &#39;S&#39;); that is, the definite range of actual possibilities which become the world in which you are authentic. Existing authentically would be quite contrary to the kind of detachment from the world which many &#39;spiritual&#39; superstitions teach - we wouldn&#39;t move &#39;out&#39; of the world but from being lost in the they-world to being solidly located in the actual world.

<p>The they-self doesn&#39;t own its choices and so doesn&#39;t disclose the temporality of knowingly choosing for the future, right now [in the present], as you have been up until this point. Authenticity entails resoluteness which, in turn, discloses a tripartite temporality (i.e., simultaneously being-towards the future, past and present). (loc 1311)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the past, present and future do not come in a succession; the future is not &#39;later&#39; than your &#39;now&#39; and your past is not &#39;earlier&#39;. Rather, they are all present in your experience at the same time. For a present sound to be part of a song, for instance, it must be integrated with what has been and what is to come (melodies exist only over time). (loc 1325)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>4.1 Temporality and Everydayness (loc 1339)</p>
<p>The normal, inauthentic, human way of being-towards the future is one of merely awaiting it. Awaiting is a passive, and inauthentic, alternative to anticipation. Anticipation is a matter of actively &#39;meeting&#39; the future in the present where, in awaiting, you simply let the future come towards you. You are, in effect, postponing your own potentiality-for-being. (loc 1375)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In contrast with making present, authentic temporalising of the present involves &#39;now&#39; being &#39;the moment of vision&#39; - the time when you actively encounter your actual possibilities. &#39;Moment of vision&#39; is a phrase used by Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) to describe what the present becomes if you sight (qv) it as the location of actual possibilities and, therefore, of authentic choice. (loc 1394)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>You cannot be-towards the present authentically (treating it as a moment of vision) without simultaneously being-towards who you have been up until the present moment; you must own the past as something which is not under your control but still constitutive of who you are. What this amounts to is repeatedly coming back to the existence that you have chosen for yourself. This &#39;coming back&#39; to a chosen existence is repetition - of being loyal to your past resolutions. If you are resolute then, rather than letting your self be tossed around by circumstances (qv, turbulence) you knowingly choose to keep repeating who you have chosen to be. (loc 1399)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the link by which temporality is the meaning of Care - is best disclosed in resoluteness because resoluteness has to do with understanding your Being as Care. This understanding in turn presupposes an openness to temporality because any resoluteness is being-towards a future character which you have decided to be as you who have been so far. To this linking of future and past, resoluteness further discloses the current moment of your existence and presupposes your openness to it; so the present is its existential context (loc 1302)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The resoluteness with which you exist authentically is a matter of taking personal responsibility for what you do with your historical Situation; you, in effect, &#39;take over&#39; your past and hand it down to yourself as an inheritance. (loc 1424)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Your past is fixed, but your Fate - your confrontation with the past - is something you can variously accept, avoid, or distort. (loc 1432)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Philosophical context</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>An ontology (qv) is a theory of Being. Everybody has an ontology, but most human ontologies are functional rather than theoretical; we simply act as if an ontology was true rather than thinking through its implications (loc 1477)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Dualism is the ontological or pre-ontological belief that reality consists of two kinds of Being: the material [natural, objective] and the immaterial or non-natural [spiritual, cultural, mental, subjective]. This has its roots in ancient religion and probably arose from the uncanniness (qv) that early humans must have felt by being conscious of the world and, therefore, of being somehow &#39;other&#39; than from the world (loc 1480)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The knowability problem, which seems inescapable for dualism, led to what Kant called &#39;the scandal of philosophy&#39; by which dualists (i.e., most humans) cannot prove the existence of an external world. (loc 1488)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Idealism is a deficient (qv) mode of Dualism which concludes that, because only the subjective/mental aspect of reality is knowably real, either only the subjective is real (ontological idealism) or, at least only subjective experience can be talked about as true (epistemological idealism). So idealism is actually idea-ism (the root is idea rather than ideal). Idealism &#39;solves&#39; both the mind-body and knowability (loc 1509)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>[Intentionality] You have only to pay attention to your own being-in-the-world to notice that all awareness is awareness by you of something, (loc 1543)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Husserl&#39;s phenomenology sought to overcome this dualism by focussing on the intentional act whereby the subject is &#39;in&#39; the world. When you are conscious of your computer, for instance, you are not conscious of an image in your head but of an object in the world. (loc 1568)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decent intro to the major macro asset classes]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to trading textbooks, I’ve found that two factors in particular correlate positively with their utility to me: whether the author has institutional risk-taking experience (high <em>believability</em>, to use Dalio’s phrase, c.f. <em>Principles</em> ), and more weakly, the length of the book – shorter ones are often higher quality (<a href="/?books=the-laws-of-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Laws of Trading</a>, <a href="/?books=advanced-portfolio-management" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Advanced Portfolio Management</a>, <a href="/?books=volatility-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Volatility Trading</a> come to mind).</p>
<p>A priori*<em>, Gliner’s</em>Global Macro Trading* seems to satisfy these two criteria, but unfortunately it might be something of a false positive. The book begins by examining what a discretionary macro trading process might look like: there is a somewhat primitive discussion of cognitive biases, useful in spirit but neither as accurate nor comprehensive as that in <a href="/?books=alpha-trader" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Alpha Trader</a>, and classic advice like “cut your losses and let your winners ride” – which I don’t necessarily disagree with, but it’s a take given without much nuance.</p>
<p>The remainder of the book is a collection of basic facts about different markets, including some prosaic aspects like contract denominations and Bloomberg functions. It is not a bad book; I got some value from the later chapters on global central banking, and notably, I did not suffer Gell-Mann amnesia – Gliner gave a good introduction to the areas I am familiar with, which gives me confidence in the quality of his introduction to those markets for which I have no expertise.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Global Macro Trading</em> is decent as a quick survey to help you “know what you don’t know”, but don’t expect to walk away with any deep new insight.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Then my heart with pleasure fills, and dances with the daffodils]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year I resolved to learn at least 12 poems by heart, in a quest to introduce more lyricism in life. Much of our cognition is centred around language, so it is no surprise that well-chosen lines of verse can alter one’s mood and perspective or amplify experience.</p>
<p>Barber’s <em>Penguin’s Poems by Heart</em> is a nice little anthology of Western classics. There isn’t really much more to say about the collection, and each poem is probably deserving of its own essay, so instead, here are some nice lines from the collection:</p>
<p>Motivation and perseverance: “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul” (Henley); “Though wise men at their end know dark is right, because their words had forked no lightning, they do not go gentle into that good night” (Dylan Thomas).</p>
<p>Appreciation of the beauty in the world: “then my heart with pleasure fills, and dances with the daffodils” (Wordsworth); “Glory be to God for dappled things […] Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches wings” (Gerard Manley Hopkins); “to hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour” (Blake).</p>
<p>Existential humility: “On the pedestal these words appear: ‘My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, look on my works, ye mighty, and despair’. Nothing beside remains.” (Shelley). “Know, one false step is ne’er retrieved, and be with caution bold. Not all that tempts your wandering eyes, and heedless hearts, is lawful prize; nor all that glisters, gold” (Thomas Gray, about his beloved cat that drowned in a tub of goldfish); “Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, and learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, do not go gentle into that good night” (Dylan Thomas).</p>
<p>Melancholy of the wandering spirit: “We’ll go no more a roving, so late into the night, though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright” (Lord Byron); “I must down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by” (Masefield); “The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep” (Robert Frost); “This World is not Conclusion. [...] Narcotics cannot still the Tooth that nibbles at the soul” (Dickinson).</p>
<p>On romance: “Better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad” (Christina Rossetti); “My luve is like a red, red rose, that’s newly sprung in June: my luve is like the melodie, that’s sweetly play’d in tune” (Robert Burns); “ I love thee with the breath, smiles tears, of all my life! – and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death” ( Elizabeth Barrett Browning)</p>
<p>Vivid imagery: “Weave a circle round him thrice, and close your eyes with holy dread, for he on honey-dew hath fed and drunk the milk of Paradise” (Coleridge); “’Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The Jaws that bite, the claws that catch!” (Lewis Carroll); “I saw the Sun even in the midst of night // I saw the Man that saw this wondrous sight” (anon).</p>

        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=what-is-history</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=what-is-history"/>
        <updated>2024-03-25T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The facts do not speak for themselves]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>What is History</em> is a compelling introduction to historiography and the philosophy of history. “History” is an overloaded word; we use it to refer to both the study of the past (History with a capital H), and the actual set of historical events that occurred in the past. This is more than just a semantic curiosity – one of Carr’s core points is that the facts of history cannot be separated from the study of History.</p>
<p>We do not have reality observation machines, and even if we did, there would simply be too many bytes of information to process. There is necessarily a step of “dimensionality reduction”, which requires some agent to decide what constitutes the historical record. These decisions necessarily imbue some causal narrative, though that narrative is simultaneously shaped by the facts (one hopes), in a strange loop that creates meaning.</p>
<p>This is but one of the strange loops that Carr explores. He notes how even the style with which history is practiced depends on the historical context and, in particular, the philosophy du jour. As philosophy migrated from the empirical tradition to the continental tradition, so too did historians become less concerned about collecting facts and more thoughtful about understanding causality (and understanding the pitfalls of understanding causality).</p>
<p>Most interesting of all is the reflexivity of history – the idea that the history (and philosophy of history) at the time can shape future events. Carr argues how Hegel was the “philosopher of the French revolution”, and certainly Marxism stands out as one of the most “influential” philosophies of the twentieth century measured in bloodshed. <em>What is History</em> is an excellent companion to Soros’ works on reflexivity – indeed, I think a vast majority of Carr’s ideas were rediscovered (or “alchemically” transmuted) into Soros’ ideas. The following passage may as well be verbatim Soros:</p>
<p>My one criticism of <em>What is History</em> is the somewhat pedestrian way in which Carr likens History to science (mostly by bringing science down to the level of History). For example, he states that modern physics “deals only with the probabilities of events taking place”. I truly am over my scientism phase and don’t believe that the scientific method is the be-all and end-all, but even so, this description is a straw man that ignores the difference between aleatory uncertainty (dice rolls) and ontological uncertainty (fundamental impossibility of knowing).</p>
<p>In summary, <em>What is History</em> is an enjoyable read – informative, brief, and steeped in dry English humour. As an added bonus, it serves as an accessible introduction to the ideas of Hegel and Marx. But beyond that, the book prompted a profound realisation: History is deeply and reflexively intertwined with its own philosophy in a way that is not quite true of other subjects. For example, scientists generally don’t concern themselves with the philosophy of the scientific method – they can just crack on with “doing” science. This makes Carr’s book not only enjoyable, but perhaps <em>necessary</em> for any aspiring student of History.</p>

<p>The awkward thing about history is that bias seems an essential element in it – even in the best of history. The fact is that the facts do not, as is sometimes said, ‘speak for themselves’, or if they do it is the historian who decides which facts shall speak – he cannot give the floor to them all (loc 587)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When Ranke in the 1830s, in legitimate protest against moralizing history, remarked that the task of the historian was ‘simply to show how it really was (wie es eigentlich gewesen)’, this not very profound aphorism had an astonishing success. (loc 1082)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>First ascertain the facts, said the Positivists, then draw your conclusions from them. In Great Britain, this view of history fitted in perfectly with the empiricist tradition which was the dominant strain in British philosophy from Locke to Bertrand Russell. The empirical theory of knowledge presupposes a complete separation between subject and object. Facts, like sense-impressions, impinge on the observer from outside, and are independent of his consciousness. The process of reception is passive: having received the data, he then acts on them. (loc 1086)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The historian is necessarily selective. The belief in a hard core of historical facts existing objectively and independently of the interpretation of the historian is a preposterous fallacy, (loc 1131)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Our picture of Greece in the fifth century B.C. is defective not primarily because so many of the bits have been accidentally lost, but because it is, by and large, the picture formed by a tiny group of people in the city of Athens. (loc 1154)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>All history is ‘contemporary history’, declared Croce; meaning that history consists essentially in seeing the past through the eyes of the present and in the light of its problems, (loc 1263)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In 1910 the American historian, Carl Becker, argued in deliberately provocative language that ‘the facts of history do not exist for any historian till he creates them’. (loc 1266)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As any working historian knows, if he stops to reflect on what he is doing as he thinks and writes, the historian is engaged on a continuous process of moulding his facts to his interpretation and his interpretation to his facts. It is impossible to assign primacy to one over the other. (loc 1395)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>My first answer therefore to the question, What is History?, is that it is a continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts, an unending dialogue between the present and the past. (loc 1402)</p>

<p>Suicide is the only perfectly free act open to individual man; every other act involves in one way or another his membership of society. (loc 1421)</p>

<p>According to the familiar account in Burckhardt’s Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, the second part of which is subtitled ‘The Development of the Individual’, the cult of the individual began with the Renaissance, when man, who had hitherto been ‘conscious of himself only as a member of a race, people, party, family or corporation’, at length ‘became a spiritual individual and recognized himself as such’. Later the cult was connected with the rise of capitalism and of Protestantism, with the beginnings of the industrial revolution and with the doctrines of laissez-faire. The rights of man and the citizen proclaimed by the French revolution were the rights of the individual. Individualism was the basis of the great nineteenth-century philosophy of utilitarianism. Morley’s essay On Compromise, a characteristic document of Victorian liberalism, called individualism and utilitarianism ‘the religion of human happiness and well-being’. ‘Rugged individualism’ was the keynote of human progress. (loc 1441)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Great history is written precisely when the historian’s vision of the past is illuminated by insights into the problems of the present. (loc 1498)</p>

<p>two important truths: first, that you cannot fully understand or appreciate the work of the historian unless you have first grasped the standpoint from which he himself approached it; secondly, that that standpoint is itself rooted in a social and historical background. (loc 1533)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Man’s capacity to rise above his social and historical situation seems to be conditioned by the sensitivity with which he recognizes the extent of his involvement in it. (loc 1599)</p>

<p>In my first lecture I said: Before you study the history, study the historian. Now I would add: Before you study the historian, study his historical and social environment. The historian, being an individual, is also a product of history and of society; and it is in this twofold light that the student of history must learn to regard him. (loc 1601)</p>

<p>It is easier to call communism ‘the brain-child of Karl Marx’ (I pluck this flower from a recent stockbrokers’ circular) than to analyse its origin and character, to attribute the Bolshevik revolution to the stupidity of Nicholas II or to German gold than to study its profound social causes, and to see in the two world wars of this century the result of the individual wickedness of Wilhelm II and Hitler rather than of some deep-seated breakdown in the system of international relations.

<p>as I am concerned, I have no belief in Divine Providence, World Spirit, Manifest Destiny, History with a capital H, or any other of the abstractions which have sometimes been supposed to guide the course of events; and I should endorse without qualification the comment of Marx: History does nothing, it possesses no immense wealth, fights no battles. It is rather man, real living man who does everything, who possesses and fights. (loc 1667)</p>

<p>The great man is an individual, and, being an outstanding individual, is also a social phenomenon of outstanding importance. […]</p>
<p>The view which I would hope to discourage is the view which places great men outside history and sees them as imposing themselves on history in virtue of their greatness, as ‘jack-in-the-boxes who emerge miraculously from the unknown to interrupt the real continuity of history’.32 Even today I do not know that we can better Hegel’s classic description: The great man of the age is the one who can put into words the will of his age, tell his age what its will is, and accomplish it. What he does is the heart and essence of his age; he actualizes his age. (loc 1745)</p>

<p>the higher degree of creativity may perhaps be assigned to those great men who, like Cromwell or Lenin, helped to mould the forces which carried them to greatness, rather than to those who, like Napoleon or Bismarck, rode to greatness on the back of already existing forces. (loc 1753)</p>

<p>The historian, as we have seen, is bound to generalize; and, in so doing, he provides general guides for future action which, though not specific predictions, are both valid and useful. But he cannot predict specific events, because the specific is unique and because the element of accident enters into (loc 1955)</p>

<p>I should now like to argue that the social sciences as a whole, since they involve man as both subject and object, both investigator and thing investigated, are incompatible with any theory of knowledge which pronounces a rigid divorce between subject and object. (loc 2021)</p>

<p>History is movement; and movement implies comparison. That is why historians tend to express their moral judgments in words of a comparative nature like ‘progressive’ and ‘reactionary’ rather than in uncompromising absolutes like ‘good’ and ‘bad’; these are attempts to define different societies or historical phenomena not in relation to some absolute standard, but in their relation to one another.

<p>the concept of absolute truth is also not appropriate to the world of history – or, I suspect, to the world of science. It is only the simplest kind of historical statement that can be adjudged absolutely true or absolutely false. At a more sophisticated level, the historian who contests, say, the verdict of one of his predecessors will normally condemn it, not as absolutely false, but as inadequate or one-sided or misleading, or the product of a point of view which has been rendered obsolete or irrelevant by later evidence. To say that the Russian revolution was due to the stupidity of Nicholas II or to the genius of Lenin is altogether inadequate – so inadequate as to be altogether misleading. But it cannot be called absolutely false. The historian does not deal in absolutes of this kind. (loc 2691)</p>

<p>The great historian – or perhaps I should say more broadly, the great thinker – is the man who asks the question, Why?, about new things or in new contexts. Herodotus, the father of history, defined his purpose in the opening of his work: to preserve a memory of the deeds of the Greeks and the barbarians, ‘and in particular, beyond everything else, to give the cause of their fighting one another’.

<p>the historian is known by the causes which he invokes. Gibbon attributed the decline and fall of the Roman Empire to the triumph of barbarism and religion. The English Whig historians of the nineteenth century attributed the rise of British power and prosperity to the development of political institutions embodying the principles of constitutional liberty. Gibbon and the English nineteenth-century historians have an old-fashioned look today because they ignore the economic causes which modern historians have moved into the forefront. (loc 2260)</p>

<p>Just as from the infinite ocean of facts the historian selects those which are significant for his purpose, so from the multiplicity of sequences of cause and effect he extracts those, and only those, which are historically significant; and the standard of historical significance is his ability to fit them into his pattern of rational explanation and interpretation. Other sequences of cause and effect have to be rejected as accidental, not because the relation between cause and effect is different, but because the sequence itself is irrelevant. The historian can do nothing with it; it is not amenable to rational interpretation, and has no meaning either for the past or the present. It is true that Cleopatra’s nose, or Bajazet’s gout, or Alexander’s monkey-bite, or Lenin’s death, or Robinson’s cigarette-smoking, had results. But it makes no sense as a general proposition to say that generals lose battles because they are infatuated with beautiful queens, or that wars occur because kings keep pet monkeys, or that people get run over and killed on the roads because they smoke cigarettes.

<p>The notion of a finite and clearly definable goal of progress in history, so often postulated by nineteenth-century thinkers, has proved inapplicable and barren. Belief in progress means belief not in any automatic or inevitable process, but in the progressive development of human potentialities. Progress is an abstract term; and the concrete ends pursued by mankind arise from time to time out of the course of history, not from some source outside it. (loc 2673)</p>

<p>Hegel clothed his absolute in the mystical shape of a world spirit, and made the cardinal error of bringing the course of history to an end in the present instead of projecting it into the future. He recognized a process of continuous evolution in the past, and incongruously denied it in the future. Those who, since Hegel, have reflected most deeply on the nature of history have seen in it a synthesis of past and future. (loc 2717)</p>

<p>Herzen’s description of Hegel’s doctrines as ‘the algebra of revolution’ was singularly apt. Hegel provided the notation, but gave it no practical content. It was left for Marx to write the arithmetic into Hegel’s algebraical equations. (loc 2929)</p>

<p>What Freud did was to extend the range of our knowledge and understanding by opening up the unconscious roots of human behaviour to consciousness and to rational enquiry. This was an extension of the domain of reason, an increase in man’s power to understand and control himself, and therefore his environment; and it represents a revolutionary and progressive achievement. In this respect, Freud complements, and does not contradict, the work of Marx. (loc 2966)</p>

<p>some historians write history which is more durable, and has more of this ultimate and objective character, than others; and these are the historians who have what I may call a long-term vision over the past and over the future. The historian of the past can make an approach towards objectivity only as he approaches towards the understanding of the future. (loc 2741)</p>

<p>The historian’s interpretation of the past, his selection of the significant and the relevant, evolves with the progressive emergence of new goals. To take the simplest of all illustrations, so long as the main goal appeared to be the organization of constitutional liberties and political rights, the historian interpreted the past in constitutional and political terms. When economic and social ends began to replace constitutional and political ends, historians turned to economic and social interpretation of the past. (loc 2745)</p>

<p>A clue to this problem of facts and values is provided by our ordinary use of the word ‘truth’ – a word which straddles the world of fact and the world of value and is made up of elements of both. Nor is this an idiosyncrasy of the English language. The words for truth in the Latin languages, the German Wahrheit, the Russian pravda, all possess this dual character. Every language appears to require this word for a truth which is not merely a statement of fact and not merely a value judgment, but embraces both elements. It may be a fact that I went to London last week. But you would not ordinarily call it a truth: (loc 2858)</p>

<p>The primary function of reason, as applied to man in society, is no longer merely to investigate, but to transform; and this heightened consciousness of the power of man to improve the management of his social, economic and political affairs by the application of rational processes seems to me one of the major aspects of the twentieth-century revolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deconstruction that eschews deconstructionism]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Invisible Cities</em> was my favourite fictional read of 2023 (actively adjusting for recency bias) – perhaps inching onto my all-time top ten. It is also a terribly difficult book to review, hence the delay – I have been chipping away at this one for months.</p>
<p><em>Invisible Cities</em> is structured as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, in which Polo recounts his travels to 55 different cities, each tale less than two pages long, interspersed with dreamlike dialogue between Polo and Khan. The cities are fanciful and metaphorical: there is Thekla, the city that is forever under construction because its inhabitants are afraid of the destruction that construction eventually entails; Ersilia, the city where people hang threads form house-to-house to mark relationships, migrating to a new location when the threads become impassable leaving behind only the threads; Andria, the city which mimics the heavens and which the heavens mimic.</p>
<p>So I have told you what the book is about, and yet this does nothing to present the <em>meaning</em> of the book. Above I have given nothing more than a dissection, and in a Heideggerian sense, dissection does nothing to disclose being. In fact, I believe that is one of the core themes of <em>Invisible Cities</em> – exploring whether deconstruction can lead to a synthesis of meaning.</p>
<p>It initially seems like each city is designed to highlight a specific aspect of society or human nature, though sometimes the lesson is as inscrutable as that of a Zen koan. But as we read on, particularly with the reflective dialogue, we realise that the tales are deeply interlinked. Some editions’ blurbs give the “spoiler” that Marco is actually describing 55 different aspects of Venice. This is perhaps the publisher’s attempt to hint at the deeper layers of the book, to convince prospective readers that it isn’t just a thin travelogue, but that still criminally undersells the complexity of the book. Marco (Calvino?) is not describing 55 different cities, nor 55 aspects of any city, but attempting to describe every city, and every possible city, and further still, he is describing the ways in which one can describe a city and examining whether that is the same as understanding <em>meaning</em> .</p>
<p><em>Invisible Cities</em> is a meditation about the synthesis of form, simultaneously deconstructing cities while eschewing deconstructionism. It is an exploration of the human condition, and the strange loops of creation and destruction therein (indeed, I was constantly reminded of ** <em><a href="/?books=g%C3%B6del-escher-bach-an-eternal-golden-braid" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</a></em> <em>).</em> Trying to reduce form into its primitive components can result in the loss of purpose. Perhaps purpose exists in the minute textures of reality and the richly interacting tapestry those details form; <em>komorebi –</em> that beautiful Japanese word for light filtering through the trees.</p>

<p>While the description of Anastasia awakens desires one at a time only to force you to stifle them, when you are in the heart of Anastasia one morning your desires waken all at once and surround you.

<p>It is pointless to decide whether Zenobia is to be classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.</p>

<p>Summed to lay down the rules for the foundation of Perinthia, the astronomers established the place and the day according to the position of the stars; they drew the intersecting lines of the decumanus and the cardo, the first oriented to the passage of the sun and the other like the axis on which the heavens turn. They divided the map according to the twelve houses of the zodiac so that each temple and each neighborhood would receive the proper influence of the favoring constellations; they fixed the point in the walls where gates should be cut, foreseeing how each would frame an eclipse of the moon in the next thousand years. Perinthia they guaranteed - would reflect the harmony of the firmament; nature&#39;s reason and the gods&#39; benevolence would shape the inhabitants&#39; destinies. Following the astronomers&#39; calculations precisely, Perinthia was constructed; various peoples came to populate it; the first generation born in Perinthia began to grow within its walls; and these citizens reached the age to marry and have children.</p>
<p>In Perinthia&#39;s streets and square today you encounter cripples, dwarfs, hunchbacks, obese men, bearded women.But the worse cannot be seen; guttural howls are heard from cellars and lofts, where families hide children with three heads or with six legs. Perinthia&#39;s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is reflected exactly in the city of monsters.</p>

<p>“In Raissa, Life is not happy”. People wring their hand as they walk in the streets, curse the crying children, lean on the railings over the river and press their firsts to the temples.</p>

<p>&quot;Our city and the sky correspond so perfectly,&quot; they answered, &quot;that any change in Andria involves some novelty among the stars.&quot; The astronomers, after each change takes place in Andria, peer into their telescopes and report a nova&#39;s explosion, or a remote point in the firmament&#39;s change of color from orange to yellow, the expansion of a nebula, the bending of a spiral of the Milky Way. Each change implies a sequence of other changes, in Andria as among the stars: the city and the sky never remain the same. As for the character of Andria&#39;s inhabitants, two virtues are worth mentioning: self-confidence and prudence. Convinced that every innovation in the city influences the sky&#39;s pattern, before taking any decision they calculate the risks and advantages for themselves and for the city and for all worlds.</p>

<p>From now on, I&#39;ll describe the cities to you,&quot; the Khan had said, &quot;in your journeys you will see if they exist.&quot; But the cities visited by Marco Polo were always different from those thought of by the emperor. &quot;And yet I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced,&quot; Kublai said. &quot;It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combinations.&quot; &quot;I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others,&quot; Marco answered. &quot;It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real.&quot;</p>

Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name” …</p>
<p>The atlas has these qualities: it reveals the form of cities that do not yet have a form or a name. […] The catalogue of forms is endless: until every shape has founds its city, new cities will continue to be born.</p>

<p>Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.</p>
<p>&quot;But which is the stone that supports the bridge?&quot; Kublai Khan asks.</p>
<p>&quot;The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,&quot; Marco answers, &quot;but by the line of the arch that they form.&quot;</p>
<p>Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds:&quot;Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Khan met him, seated at a chessboard. With a gesture he invited the Venetian to sit opposite him and describe, with the help only of the chessmen, the cities he had visited.</p>
<p>Marco did not lose heart. The Great Khan&#39;s chessmen were huge pieces of polished ivory: arranging on the board looming rooks and sulky knights, assembling swarms of pawns, drawing straight or oblique avenues like a queen&#39;s progress, Marco recreated the perspectives and the spaces of black and white cities on moonlit nights. Contemplating these essential landscapes, Kublai reflected on the invisible order that sustains cities, on the rules that decreed bow they rise, take shape and prosper, adapting themselves to the seasons, and then bow they sadden and fall in ruins. At times he thought he was on the verge of discovering a coherent, harmonious system underlying the infinite deformities and discords, but no model could stand up to the comparison with the game of chess. Perhaps, instead of racking one&#39;s brain to suggest with the wory pieces&#39; scant help visions which were anyway destined to oblivion, it would suffice to play a game according to the rules, and to consider each successive state of the board as one of the countless forms that the system of forms assembles and destroys. Now Kublai Khan no longer had to send Marco Polo on distant expeditions: he kept him playing endless games of chess. Knowledge of the empire was hidden in the pattern drawn by the angular shifts of the knight, by the diagonal, passages opened by the bishop&#39;s incursions, by the lumbering, cautious tread of the king and the humble pawn, by the inexorable ups and downs of every game. The Great Khan tried to concentrate on the game: but now it was the game&#39;s purpose that eluded him. Each game ends in a gain or a loss: but of what? What were the true stakes? At checkmate, beneath the foot of the king, knocked aside by the winner&#39;s hand, a black or a white square remains. By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire’s multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes. It was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness</p>
<p>… Then Marco Polo spoke: &quot;Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of a trunk that grew in a year of drought: you see how its fibers are arranged? Here a barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night&#39;s frost forced it to desist.&quot; Until then the Great Khan had not realized that the foreigner knew how to express himself fluently in his language, but it was not this fluency that amazed him. &quot;Here is a thicker pore: perhaps it was a larvum&#39;s nest; not a woodworm, because, once born, it would have begun to dig, but a caterpillar that gnawed the leaves and was the cause of the tree&#39;s being chosen for chopping down... This edge was scored by the wood carver with his gouge so that it would adhere to the next square, more protruding. ...&quot; The quantity of things that could be read in a little piece of wood</p>

KUBLAI: I, too, am not sure I am here, strolling among the porphyry fountains, listening to the plashing echo, and not riding, caked with sweat and blood, at the head of my army, conquering the lands you will have to describe, or cutting off the fingers of the attackers scaling the walls of a besieged fortress. POLO: Perhaps this garden exists only in the shadow of our lowered eyelids, and we have never stopped: you, from raising dust on the fields of battle; and I, from bargaining for sacks of pepper in distant bazaars. But each time we half-close our eyes, in the midst of the din and the throng, we are allowed to withdraw here, dressed in silk kimonos, to ponder what we are seeing and living, to draw conclusions, to contemplate from the distance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And Polo said: &quot;The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can’t take it with you, old sport]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tag along with me in New York, and you’ll swiftly grow weary of my oft-repeated phrase: “you can’t take it with you, old sport”. This is a quip that other people in my circle have started adopting – it’s remarkably convenient in response to a particularly hefty dinner bill (those starters add up!), your standard overpriced beverage, or the outrageous entry fee for a particular concert/venue. It’s a flippant statement and I am cavalier with its use, but it represents a brainworm that I have been seriously mulling over for the better part of a year. In essence, the thesis is that money has no value when you’re dead since you can’t take it with you. Therefore, <em>dulce and decorum est</em> to spend it all before you die.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean wanton materialism and lavish spending on luxury. Rather, it demands that you perform two specific tasks: 1) Determine the maximum sustainable spending rate that will leave you with your desired retirement income, plus an emergency fund, plus enough cash to pay for future big expenses like a down payment or kids’ schooling 2) Decide how to allocate your spending to maximise your happiness. Happiness here does not purely mean short-term happiness – not just rent on Nozick’s experience machine – but the long-term happiness that comes from having a life well-lived, full of experiences (pleasurable and challenging), while being of sound character and mind.</p>
<p>This is a difficult problem! Step one requires both technical and analytical skills to reason about finances, savings growth, and future earnings paths (and dealing with their stochasticity)… but that’s the easy part. Step two requires self-knowledge, not just of your current self, but future you, since that is the person whose regret you are trying to minimise. How does one attain this self-knowledge? Quoting <a href="/?books=the-delphic-maxims-in-literature" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Delphic Maxims in Literature</a>, one needs:</p>
<p>This introduces a circularity: to gain self-knowledge, one needs experiences. To decide what experiences are worth acquiring (and optimally allocating dollars and time to achieve those experiences), one needs self-knowledge.</p>
<p>This is a long preamble and thus far I haven’t mentioned the book. But it just so happens that the thesis of <em>Die With Zero</em> is quite literally identical to what I have written above. It’s a nice feeling when you find a book that explains a philosophy you have independently converged on. There is a sense of clarity, revelation, and vindication as some of the hazy nameless concepts move are given a definite shape, and can thus move from intuition to cognition.</p>
<p>Despite the book not being new to me, <em>Die With Zero</em> was a much-needed kick up the backside to be thoughtful about the experiences I want to have. I confess that the book has caused me some sleepless nights, staring up at the ceiling in fear that I am not being sufficiently intentional and thus not getting all that I could be from life. That might sound psychotic, but maybe it’s better to have that anxiety now and let it motivate me to go and do memorable things, rather than being on that sad height, cursing and blessing younger people with fierce tears.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the Scotch/Singaporean blood in me still revolts at spending more than necessary. And that’s the funny thing (it sounds stupid to even write it): for responsible people, trained in frugality, raised to value intangible things like character and education rather than luxury and material possessions, it is difficult to overcome the psychological reluctance to spend money – even if you are spending to acquire experiences that will ultimately enrich the soul! One truly needs some kind of mantra, some kind of rejoinder when doubt creeps in. Use mine: you can’t take it with you, old sport.</p>

<p>This book is not about making your money grow—it’s about making your life grow. (loc 53)</p>

<p>So it makes sense to delay gratification to some extent, because that pays off in the long run. But the sad truth is that too many people delay gratification for too long, or indefinitely. They put off what they want to do until it’s too late, saving money for experiences they will never enjoy. Living as if your life were infinite is the opposite of taking the long view: It’s terribly shortsighted. (loc 83)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it makes no sense to let opportunities pass us by for fear of squandering our money. Squandering our lives should be a much greater worry. (loc 98)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>increase your overall lifetime fulfillment, it’s important to have each experience at the right age. (loc 121)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>money represents life energy. Life energy is all the hours that you’re alive to do things—and whenever you work, you spend some of that finite life energy. So any amount of money you’ve earned through your work represents the amount of life energy you spent earning that money. (loc 187)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Experts in retirement planning even have some lingo for this consumption pattern: go-go years, slow-go years, and no-go years. The idea is that when you’re first retired, you’re raring to have all those experiences you’ve been putting off until retirement, and you still (for the most part) have the health and energy to pursue those experiences. Those are your go-go years. Later on, typically in your seventies, you begin to slow down as you cross items off your bucket list and your health declines. And later still, in your eighties or beyond, you don’t have a whole lot of “go” left at all, no matter how much money you still have. (loc 721)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Experiences over possessions</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>I’m a big believer in the value of experiences. Experiences don’t have to cost a lot of money, and they can even be free, but worthwhile experiences do usually cost some money. The unforgettable trip, the concert tickets, the pursuit of an entrepreneurial dream or a new hobby—all these experiences cost money, and sometimes they cost a lot of money. To me, that is money well worth spending. Many psychological studies have shown that spending money on experiences makes us happier than spending money on things. Unlike material possessions, which seem exciting at the beginning but then often depreciate quickly, experiences actually gain in value over time: They pay what I call a memory dividend, (loc 218)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Recommendation: Start actively thinking about the life experiences you’d like to have, and the number of times you’d like to have them. The experiences can be large or small, free or costly, charitable or hedonistic. But think about what you really want out of this life in terms of meaningful and memorable experiences. (loc 286)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the main thing you’ll be retiring on will be your memories—so make sure you invest enough in those. (loc 477)</p>

<p>yes, you can certainly leave money to the people and causes you care about—but the truth is that those people and causes would be better off getting your wealth sooner rather than later. Why wait until after you die? (loc 669)</p>

<p>billionaire philanthropist Chuck Feeney calls “giving while living.” Feeney, who made his fortune as a founder of Duty Free Shoppers Group (the duty-free stores you see in airports), is a great role model for what I’m advocating: He started giving his money away (anonymously) early, and by the time he was in his eighties he had given away more than $8 billion of his wealth.

<p>You should be living today in much the way that you’ll be living in 10 or 15 years, and it’s crazy to actually be scrimping and saving (loc 1325)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Think about the three basics people need to have to get the most out of life: health, free time, and money. The problem is that these things rarely all come together at once. (loc 1521)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you pay to get out of doing tasks you don’t enjoy, you are simultaneously reducing the number of negative life experiences and increasing the number of positive life experiences (for which you now have more time). How can that not make you happier with your life? (loc 1635)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>your ability to extract enjoyment from money declines with age? Well, the corollary to that is that the older you are, the more someone should have to pay you to delay an experience. How much they should pay you is what I call your personal interest rate—which rises with your age. This idea immediately hits home for people in finance, who are used to thinking about interest rates and the time value of money. (loc 1643)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Las Vegas at 40 is much better than Las Vegas at 20, assuming you have significantly more money at 40 than at 20. It’s like two different Las Vegases. (loc 1680)</p>

<p>We all die a multitude of deaths throughout our lives […] this universal process, of passing from one stage in your life to the next.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The teenager in you dies, the college student in you dies, the single unattached you dies, the version of you that’s a parent of an infant dies, and so on. Once each of these mini-deaths occurs, there’s no going back. (loc 1733)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>most people just have the sense that there’s no time urgency near home; they act as if they will always be able to visit that museum or that nearby beach or that friend some other time. (loc 1794)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Time buckets are a simple tool for discovering what you want your life to look like in broad strokes. Here’s what I suggest you do. Draw a timeline of your life from now to the grave, then divide it into intervals of five or ten years. Each of those intervals—say, from age 30 to 40, or from 70 to 75—is a time bucket, which is just a random grouping of years. Then think about what key experiences—activities or events—you definitely want to have during your lifetime. We all have dreams in life, but I have found that it’s extremely helpful to actually write them all down in a list. (loc 1805)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As you’re making your list, don’t worry about money; money at this point is just a distraction from the overall goal, which is to envision what you want your life to be like. Then, once you have your list of items, start to drop each of your hoped-for pursuits into the specific buckets, based on when you’d ideally have each experience. (loc 1817)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Women desire sovereignty over men]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Wife of Bath’s Tale</em> is just an all-around outrageous read. I confess that I had low expectations, perhaps due to some kind of historical elitism which made me doubt that anything of value could be written in the Middle Ages (Dante’s <em>Commedia</em> and <em>The Tale of Genji</em> are among the exceptions that come to mind). I had assumed that the <em>Canterbury Tales</em> would be old-fashioned, primitive, and only suitable as bedtime stories to children (this was the most egregious of my incorrect assumptions).</p>
<p>Initially, the General Prologue seems to confirm those suspicions, with its dull and repetitive enumeration of all the pilgrims. So when you get to the Wife of Bath’s prologue, you’re sort of mindlessly reading it, eyes glazed, the rhyming verse and archaic language lulling you on… when all of a sudden your subconscious sends a jolt to your conscious brain and you’re like what the FLIP did I just read. Then you go back over the previous page and realise that the sentences you just glossed over are <em>shocking.</em> Shocking in various ways – both perspicacious and raunchy, cultured and crass (dropping C-bombs in the middle of verse?).</p>
<p>The Wife’s Tale itself is deservedly famous, with its punchline that what women most desire is sovereignty over men. But when taken in conjunction with the prologue, the text becomes a rich exploration of feminism and romance rather than just a nice story to tell around a campfire. The thesis that women most desire sovereignty is jostled with, both supported and tested in several layers throughout the Prologue and Tale – subtly with Queen Guinevere being allowed to intercede on behalf of the knight and explicitly when the knight allows the old lady to choose her path.</p>
<p>In the Prologue, the wife discusses her five husbands, “Three of them were good, and two were bad”, and uses this to discuss her progressive views of the treatment of women. The prologue is an entertaining read. At times, it is downright crass, for example when she explains how she would withhold sex from husbands until they paid a ransom, at which point she would “satisfy their lusts” with “feigned appetite” (!!). But it is also sophisticated and erudite, with frequent references to ancient philosophy and Greek mythology. She had particularly sharp reasoning when it came to biblical double standards regarding the sexuality of women – if the Apostle Paul believes virginity is such a good thing in women, who is going to mother those virgin girls? The Prologue also explores complex themes like abusive relationships: consider that her fifth husband Jankyn, whom she admits was her most beloved, would beat her viciously and make her listen to him read from his <em>Book of Wikked Wyves.</em></p>
<p>On a serious note, it’s fairly disappointing that as of 2024 the <em>Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale</em> still stands out as a progressive and feminist text, 700 years after Chaucer first penned the tales! The more I read pre-Enlightenment works, the more I become sceptical of Hegel’s notion that the World spirit of humanity (the <em>geist</em> ) is truly maturing and evolving. There is doubtless some privilege in that sentence, because the Enlightenment presumably did bring up the median level of enlightenment, and undoubtedly the median person is <em>much</em> better off than they were in the time of Chaucer. In any case, reading the <em>Wife of Bath’s Tale</em> is a reminder that there are ways in which society has not changed as much as one might have hoped.</p>
<hr>
<h3>TL;DR of the Wife’s Tale</h3>
<p>An Arthurian knight rapes a maiden and is condemned to death, but Queen Guinevere will spare his life if he can discover what it is that women most desire. He is given a year, and in this year he travels widely but can’t get a clear answer. Some women say sexual pleasure, some say flattery, and some say wealth. As he trudges back to the court, awaiting his fair, he stumbles upon an old lady who says that she will give him the answer that saves him, but he must grant her a wish.</p>
<p>The answer she gives him is that women desire <em>sovereignty</em>, which pleases the Queen and the knight is freed. But in return, the old lady asks for the knight’s hand in marriage. On the bridal bed, seeing his disgust, the lady gives the knight a choice: she can be old and ugly but completely loyal and faithful, or young and beautiful but then he has to roll the dice on fidelity. He ultimately lets her decide. Having demonstrated that he internalised the idea of sovereignty, she grants him both – transforming into a beautiful young woman.</p>

<p>We women have, if I am not to lie, In this love matter, a quaint fantasy; Look out a thing we may not lightly have, And after that we’ll cry all day and crave. Forbid a thing, and that thing covet we; Press hard upon us, then we turn and flee Sparingly offer we our goods, when fair; Great crowds at market make for dearer ware, And what’s too common brings but little price; All this knows every woman who is wise.

<p>For trust me, it’s impossible, no libel, That any cleric shall speak well of wives, Unless it be of saints and holy lives But naught for other women will they do. Who painted first the lion, tell me who? By God, if women had but written stories, As have these clerks within their oratories, They would have written of men more wickedness Than all the race of Adam could redress. (loc 2243)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange things happen when even light can’t escape gravity]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reading <em>Black Holes</em> was a nostalgic experience. I haven’t read a popular science book in years, though at one point, it must have been my most-read genre. In fact, books like this – including <em>Why Does E=mc²</em> and <em>The Quantum Universe</em> by the same authors – were a large part of what inspired me to study physics at university, where my interest in the subject was promptly diluted.</p>
<p>I suppose this experience created in me a certain bitterness towards popular physics books. Perhaps I felt they misled me about the qualia of physics as a profession by concealing some of the fairly uninteresting prerequisite classical physics – notable offenders for me were rotational mechanics and electrodynamics.</p>
<p>That said, reading <em>Black Holes</em> , I developed a grudging respect for Cox and Forshaw’s genuine attempts to explain the technicalities, rather than copping out with Michio Kaku-esque futurism and grand concepts. The corollary, however, is that the book is astonishingly difficult! With substantial effort, residual knowledge from my degree, and several re-reads of passages with a pencil in hand to sketch diagrams, I was just about able to follow the Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetime. I got progressively lost as the discussion turned to Kerr spacetime and wormholes, then had a brief respite with black hole thermodynamics, but was completely in the woods for holography and the black hole information paradox.</p>
<p>Therefore, reading the book was a frustrating experience, and I confess that it inspired bitter thoughts like “How on Earth could a layperson get anything from this book?”. But on reflection, the frustrated befuddlement that the book evoked is what makes it valuable. The book is an “anti-library” (as much as I hate to borrow the Talebbian term) – the authors show you how much knowledge is out there and do their best to sketch the shape of the knowledge tree. Perhaps some branches on this tree are destined to be traversed, as was the case for the teenage version of myself who ultimately did learn some “actual physics”, but surely the vast majority of them are consigned to remain unknown to us. Still, by knowing that those branches exist, we can perhaps appreciate how beautiful the tree must be.</p>

<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The Mercator projection is a conformal projection: it preserves angles, such that a straight line on a Mercator map corresponds to a compass bearing.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Equivalence principle: acceleration and gravity are locally indistinguishable, which led Einstein to think of gravity more as a geometric phenomenon rather than a force in the traditional sense.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Schwarzschild black holes:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Schwarzschild radius: set escape velocity to the speed of light</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Within the event horizon, the radial coordinate becomes timelike – the singularity is an infinite surface at a moment in time. Hence, just like we typically can’t avoid moving forward in time, inside a Schwarzschild black hole we can’t avoid moving radially inwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Kerr black holes:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The singularity is a ring – not all paths must hit it</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Ergosphere: region outside the event horizon where spacetime is being dragged around so that it’s impossible to stand still. At this point, a radial outward light beam will freeze, but it is still possible to escape due to the swirling.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">There are two event horizons: after the first, it is inevitable that you reach the second. But after the second, you can avoid the singularity.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">For a fast spinning black hole, the event horizon disappears and there is a naked ring singularity. It is unknown whether such a thing can exist in nature (Stephen Hawking made a famous bet on this), but one can’t simply make one by adding spinning mass to a rotating black hole, as in GR there is a repulsion between rotating objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">General facts on black holes:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Black holes are very elegant objects, as the only parameters are mass, spin, and charge.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Even if they swallow a star, they quickly return to external equilibrium. Hence, all spacetime outside of black holes must be Schwarzschild or Kerr.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Black hole thermodynamics:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Entropy = (log of) number of micro states = (log of) number of bits required to convey information of state</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Puzzle: black holes are very simple objects with no internal structure, so it would see that they have no entropy. But then throwing things in would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Bekenstein’s calculation to show that entropy is proportional to area:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Each photon can carry one bit of info (e.g. in its polarisation)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The maximum number of photons is Mc^2 / (hc/lambda), but the largest wavelength we can use is the Schwarzschild radius</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Result is that the number of bits is equal to the surface area / 4*(planck length)^2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Black holes have the maximum entropy possible per unit mass: if we add some regular mass M, the black hole mass will increase and so will its area (which is proportional to entropy). But if we add some max-entropy mass, its area increases the same amount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Hawking radiation: virtual particles pop in and out of the vacuum, but rather than annihilating, the one on the inside can’t escape.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Black hole information paradox: Black holes release thermal Hawking radiation (no information), but they also shrink and eventually evaporate. Doesn’t this mean that information is eventually loss</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Black hole complementarity:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">By the equivalence principle, a free falling observer should not see any radiation because they experience the virtual particles the same way as in free space. The infaller will be spaghettified.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Someone hovering near the horizon will measure very high temperature, and see an in-faller get vaporised.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Complementarity says that both of these happen. This resolves the information paradox, because outside observers recover the information in the vaporised ashes.</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Heroes</em> picks up where <a href="/?books=mythos" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Mythos</a> left off – at the terminus of the Age of the Olympians and the beginning of the Age of Heroes. Many of these stories will likely be vaguely familiar to the reader, if only due to the various modern adaptations like <em>Percy Jackson, Troy</em>, and Disney’s <em>Hercules.</em> The nice thing about reading the tales in long form is that you realise how much nuance was withheld in the more child-friendly versions: I certainly don&#39;t recall Disney’s Hercules slaying his wife and two children while suffering from hallucinations sent by Hera…</p>
<p>In this vein, one of the fascinating takeaways from this anthology is that these Greek heroes are celebrated, and their exploits are still storied two millennia later, despite their deep flaws and tragic endings. A brief obituary of the heroes in this collection reads like a dark version of Dumb Ways to Die:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Heracles – perhaps the greatest of the demigods – burned himself alive rather than suffer from the hydra venom (the same hydra he had slain!), by which he had been unwittingly poisoned by his wife.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Orpheus – the most talented musician in antiquity, whose music persuaded Hades to release Eurydice – torn limb from limb by lustful women (a fate I hope to avoid).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Jason – who retrieved the Golden Fleece – crushed by the stern of <em>Argo</em>, which fell on him while he was having a nap.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Atalanta – the famed hunter and servant of Artemis – turned into a lion by Zeus after Aphrodite inflicted her with a passion that made her have sex with Hippomenes in Zeus’ temple.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Theseus – the famed Athenian who slayed the Minotaur – exiled from Athens for failing to deal with rebels and eventually pushed off a cliff after having an argument with his host.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Oedipus – his impressive riddle-solving (Sphinx) and leadership as Thebes’ ruler notwithstanding – gouged his eyes out after finding out that he had canoodled his mother and died in exile.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Bellerophon – rider of Pegasus and slayer of the Chimera – zapped by Zeus after trying to fly Pegasus to Olympus in an act of hubris and died a friendless cripple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only Perseus escaped tragedy, living into old age as a trusted and wise ruler, besides his wife Andromeda. There is a certain maturity in all this, characteristic of the Greeks: the deep recognition that flawed people can do heroic things, or noble heroic people can “live long enough to see themselves become a villain”.</p>
<p>I find myself agreeing with some other reviewers that <em>Heroes</em> is not quite as good as <a href="/?books=mythos" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Mythos</a>. <em>Heroes</em> has a certain glibness that detracts from the tragedy – nuanced tales of human effort triumph and failure are somewhat belittled by Fry’s snark. But like with <a href="/?books=mythos" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Mythos</a>, I think Fry does an admirable job both reinvigorating the age-old tales and explaining why myth matters. I particularly enjoyed the commentary about 20th century philosophers; for example, Nietzche saw the story of Oedipus as a dialectic between the Apollonian aspects of our nature – after all Oedipus was the intelligent and noble King of Thebes – and the dark Dionysian undercurrents in us.</p>
<p>When it comes to heroes, as opposed to gods, there is also an interesting element of historicity. In the afterword, Fry discusses “euhemerism” – the idea that myths are loosely based on historical events (for example, the Chimera that Bellerophon slayed may have represented Chimaerrus’ pirate ship, with a lion prow and serpent on the sternpost). Whether or not this is true, I think there is a certain charm in this idea – the Greeks mythologised these real-life heroes, without glossing over the negatives of the characters, though allowing for some unexplainable behaviours as simply the caprice of the Gods. Perhaps Dionysus might have had something to do with my poor behaviour last weekend.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Heracles</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Only as the life went out of the monster and it slipped dead to the floor did Hera lift the mist of delusion she had visited on him. Looking down, he now saw with appalling clarity that the dragon he had killed was his wife Megara and the two demons were his beloved children. (loc 1165)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Eurystheus, who must surely have been getting used to the disappointment of seeing Heracles return unscathed by now, dedicated the mares to Hera and bred them for his own thoroughbreds. Later Greeks believed that it was from this line that Alexander the Great’s famous mount, Bucephalus, was descended. (loc 1556)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“You see?” said Prometheus. “It is your fate to be Heracles the hero, burdened with labors, yet it is also your choice. You choose to submit to it. Such is the paradox of living. We willingly accept that we have no will.” (loc 1843)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Bellerophon</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>At school Bellerophon had been taught that in the earliest times of the gods Poseidon created the very first horse as a gift for his sister Demeter. The god had fashioned all kinds of different animals, which he had thrown away before he managed to hit on the perfect creation. The discarded animals—the failures—had been the hippopotamus, the giraffe, the camel, the donkey, and the zebra, each one getting closer to the perfect dimensions, beauty, and balance of the horse. (loc 2549)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One day he mounted Pegasus and rode the winged horse up to Mount Olympus. “The gods will welcome me,” he told himself. “I am of their blood. I have always been marked out for greatness.” Such hubris was a blasphemy that could not go unpunished. When Zeus saw Bellerophon flying toward the summit, he sent a gadfly to torment Pegasus. The insect’s vicious sting maddened the horse, who bucked and reared, throwing Bellerophon. The hero plummeted down through the thin air, smashing his hip on the rocks far below. Pegasus landed on the top of Olympus and Zeus kept him there as his glamorous pack animal, charged with carrying his thunderbolts. Bellerophon dragged out the rest of his days shunned by society for his sacrilege, until he died a crippled, embittered, and lonely old man. (loc 2906)</p>

<p>The island’s seer told Ancaeus that, while he would certainly return to Samos safe and sound, he would never taste the vineyard’s wine. On his return Ancaeus saw to his delight that the grapes had ripened beautifully and been turned into wine. He summoned the seer before him and raised a cup of the wine to his lips. “So much for your false prophecies,” he said, waving the cup in the seer’s face. “I should sack you for incompetence.” “There’s many a slip ’twixt cup and lip,” said the seer. Just as Ancaeus was about to take a drink, a clamor rose up outside. A wild boar was ravaging the vineyard. Ancaeus put down the cup and ran out to inspect the damage. The boar charged out, tossed him on his tusks, and gored him to death. (loc 4425)</p>

<p>Now Medea prepared to kill her sons. It might seem that what Medea was about to do is the most terrible of her catalog of gruesome crimes; but in <em>Medea</em> , Euripides puts in her mouth a great speech in which she prevaricates over whether or not to do the deed. It stands as one of the great soliloquies in drama. From it Medea emerges sympathetically as a tragic and wholly human dramatic hero. (loc 4464)</p>

<p>At last the Ciconian women could bear the degradation and insult of being ignored no longer and, in a Bacchic frenzy, they tore Orpheus to pieces, pulling off his limbs, and wrenching the head from his shoulders.135 The golden harmonies of Apollo were always an affront to the dark Dionysian dances and dithyrambs. (loc 3150)</p>

<p>There was a certain way to settle the question once and for all. He made his way to the oracle at Delphi. He did not know what he expected in reply to the simple, bald question, “Who are my true parents?” but it was not the simple, bald answer he received. Oedipus will kill his father and mate with his mother. (loc 5139)</p>

<p>Friedrich Nietzsche in his book The Birth of Tragedy, have seen in Oedipus a character who works out on stage the tension in Athenians (and all of us) between the reasoning, mathematically literate citizen and the transgressive blood criminal; between the thinking and the instinctual being; between the superego and the id; between the Apollonian and the Dionysian impulses that contend within us. Oedipus is a detective who employs all the fields of inquiry of which the Athenians were so proud—logic, numbers, rhetoric, order, and discovery—only to reveal a truth that is disordered, shameful, transgressive, and bestial. (loc 5513)</p>

<p>When they were far out to sea Theseus looked back and thought he could see the desolate figure of Ariadne standing on the shore in the moonlight. Approaching the island from the other side they could already see the fleet of Dionysus. Theseus mourned the loss of the girl he had fallen in love with, but he knew that the safety of the young people in his charge overrode everything. He had to sacrifice his own happiness. He had to sacrifice her. (loc 6460)</p>

<p>Exiled from his kingdoms of Athens and Troezen for his role, however unwitting, in the deaths of his son and wife, wretched, bitter, desolated, and drained of all passion and purpose, Theseus came to a bathetic and pathetic end. A guest of King Lycomedes of Skyros, Theseus was pushed by his host over a cliff to his death. The cause of the argument between them is lost to us. (loc 6689)</p>

<p>Apollodorus’s Bibliotheca (Library) is a major source for all Greek myth, though he is often at variance with Hesiod and Homer. Apollonius Rhodius wrote the Argonautica, from which most of the details of Jason’s great voyage in search of the Golden Fleece are derived. (loc 6885)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Myths are not crossword puzzles or allegories with single meanings and answers. Fate, necessity, cause, and blame are endlessly mixed in these stories as they are in our lives. They were no more soluble to the Greeks than they are to us. (loc 6897)</p>

<p>In the past, even in antiquity, mythographers regularly attempted to trace almost all mythic stories back to some actual, historical truth. This is sometimes called Euhemerism or the historical theory of mythology. It is true that archaeology has shown that a Troy really existed, and a Mycenae. Bronze Age and Minoan wall paintings in Crete show bull-leaping and a maze-like structure that suggests the reality of the Labyrinth. Centaurs and Amazons are seen as Greek explanations for the arrival from the east of horses and their archer riders. Another good example of Euhemerism is the idea that the Chimera defeated by Bellerophon was in fact the pirate ship of Cheimarrhus with its lion’s figurehead for a prow and serpent for a sternpost. There are plenty of opportunities for that kind of interpretation, as well as for more metaphysical and psychological speculation too. (loc 6900)</p>

<p>Carl Jung described myths as the product of our “collective unconscious.” Joseph Campbell put it another way and called them “public dreams.” (loc 6906)</p>

<p>Scholars and mythographers are interested in what is known as “double determination,” the tendency of poets, playwrights, and other authors to attribute agency and causality to both the inner person and an outer influence, a god or an oracle, for example. If Athena “whispers in your ear,” is it just a poetical way of saying that a clever thought has struck you, or did the goddess really speak? (loc 6910)</p>

<p>Might as well call them a god as an impulse or a complex. To personify them is a rather smart way—not of managing them perhaps, but of giving shape, dimensions, and character to the uncontrollable and unfathomable forces that control us. Do “superego” and “id” reveal any more about our inner selves than Apollo and Dionysus? (loc 6929)</p>

<p>Myth can be a kind of human algebra which makes it easier to manipulate truths about ourselves. Symbols and rituals are not toys and games to be dispensed with on our arrival at adulthood, they are tools we will always need. They complement our scientific impulse; they do not stand in opposition to it. (loc 6933)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A gedankenexperiment about an unidentified black cloud in space]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Black Cloud</em> is an underrated gem of hard sci-fi – perhaps a diamond on the Mohs scale. The premise (without spoiling anything) is that an unidentified Black Cloud is spotted in space, and the fictional physicists use a combination of observational evidence and theory to deduce its nature and predict its behaviour. What distinguishes <em>The Black Cloud</em> is the rigour with which Sir Fred Hoyle (a legendary astrophysicist) traces premises to their conclusions, at times even walking through the requisite basic mathematics required to explain concepts like stellar parallax to determine astrophysical distances.</p>
<p>Functionally, it is a playful series of gedankenexperiments, sewed together with narrative fiction and light but enjoyable forays into philosophy and sociology. As is common with hard sci-fi, the quality of the fiction does suffer somewhat, with a simple plot structure and fairly one-dimensional characters. But that doesn’t bother me so much – <em>The Black Cloud</em> was one of my favourite reads this year because it did something remarkable: it sparked a nostalgia for my astrophysics degree! I derived a lot of joy from following along with the back-of-the-envelope calculations and physical deductions in the book – they are exactly the kind of techniques one uses in the infamous <em>Topics in Astrophysics</em> course in 3rd-year astrophysics at Cambridge, which is perhaps unsurprising given that Hoyle was the founding director of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, which administers the astrophysics course to this day.</p>
<p>I will leave the reader of this review to decide whether they are excited by the prospect of astrophysical thought experiments, but I found it deeply enjoyable.</p>

<p>&#39;Viewed from a wholly logical point of view the bearing and rearing of children is a thoroughly unattractive proposition. To a woman it means pain and endless worry. To a man it means extra work extending over many years to support his family. So, if we were wholly logical about sex, we should probably not bother to reproduce at all. Nature takes care of this by making us utterly and wholly irrational. If we were not irrational we simply wouldn&#39;t be able to survive, contradictory as this may sound. It&#39;s probably the same with all the other animals too?’</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Since the Universe comprises everything, it is evident that nothing can lie outside it. The idea of a &quot;god&quot; creating the Universe is a mechanistic absurdity clearly derived from the making of machines by men. I take it that we are in agreement about all this.</p>
<p>&#39;Yet many mysterious questions remain. Probably you have wondered whether a larger-scale intelligence than your own exists. Now you know that it does. In a like fashion I ponder on the existence of a larger-scale intelligence than myself. There is none within the Galaxy, and none within other galaxies so far as I am yet aware. Yet there is strong evidence, I feel, that such an intelligence does play an overwhelming part in our existence. Otherwise how is it decided how matter shall behave? How are your laws of physics determined? Why those laws and no others?</p>
<p>&quot;These problems are of outstanding difficulty, so difficult that I have not been able to solve them. What is clear however is that such an intelligence, if it exists, cannot be spatially or temporally limited in any way.</p>
<p>&#39;Although I say these problems are of extreme difficulty there is evidence that they can be solved. Some two thousand million years ago one of us claimed to have reached a solution. A transmission was sent out making this claim, but before the solution itself was broadcast the transmission came to an abrupt end. Attempts were made to re-establish contact with the individual con-cerned, but the attempts were not successful. Nor could any physical trace of the individual be found.</p>
<p><em>Reminscent of Asimov’s The Last Question</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Genius is not a biological phenomenon. A child does not possess genius at birth: genius is learned. Biologists who maintain otherwise ignore the facts of their own science, namely that the human species has not been selected for genius, nor is there evidence that genius is transmitted between parent and child.</p>
<p>&quot;The infrequency of genius is to be explained in simple probabilities, A child must learn a great deal before it reaches adult life. Processes such as the multiplying of numbers can be learned in a variety of ways, This is to say, the brain can develop in a number of ways, all enabling it to multiply numbers, but not all with by any means the same facility.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A practical how-to guide that has been used in actual coups]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One particular Americanism is the study of civics in high school. This is not something universal, and it is maybe instructive to reflect on why it isn’t, i.e. why some governments prefer their citizens not to understand the machinery of state. In any case, lacking such an education in civics, <em>Coup d’Etat</em> was a fascinating deconstructionist introduction to the subject – in this case, perhaps literally deconstructionist in that it gives a practical guide to penetrating and manipulating the state. Luttwak’s book has the unique honour of having been practically used as a guide in several coups, with bloodied copies of it found on the desks of recently deceased conspirators in the wake of failed coup attempts.</p>
<p>In reading <em>Coup d’Etat</em> , I had hoped for a selection of case studies along with distilled lessons. Unfortunately, the book is instead more of a step-by-step guide to orchestrating a coup, which goes into the prosaic details like giving you a table template to identify which figures of the government need to be neutralised – though I am fairly amused by the thought of modern coup conspirators setting this up in Notion. The book is therefore dry at times, and it is hard to feel like you are getting deep insight, but perhaps this highlights the important lesson is that coups are often technical feats of statecraft rather than violent military upheavals.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of <em>Coup d’Etat</em> is its preface, which strikes me as highly controversial, maybe even “cancellable” in some circles. He takes a remarkably reactionary view <em>against</em> decolonisation, not going so far as arguing that colonialism was a good thing, but unambiguously saying that many “backwards countries” (his words, to be clear) became independent too soon. If one can suppress outrage long enough to consider his argument, especially in the context of his deep study of the history of coups, his hypothesis is hard to immediately reject.</p>
<p>I could see the book being a useful reference to help understand an ongoing coup. Still, generally, I did not come away from <em>Coup d’Etat</em> feeling like I had a significantly richer knowledge of history or politics.</p>

<p>the feasibility of the coup derives from a comparatively recent development: the rise of the modern state with its professional bureaucracy and standing armed forces. The power of the modern state largely depends on this permanent machinery, which, with its archives, files, records, and officials, can follow intimately and, if it so desires, control the activities of lesser organizations and individuals. (loc 335)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>if the bureaucrats are linked to the leadership, an illegal seizure of power must take the form of a “Palace Revolution,” (loc 344)</p>

<p>The coup is a much more democratic affair. It can be conducted from the “outside” and operates in the area outside the government but within the state—the area formed by the permanent, professional civil service, the armed forces, and the police. The aim is to detach the permanent employees of the state from the political leadership, and usually this cannot be done if the two are linked by political, ethnic, or traditional loyalties. (loc 349)</p>

<p>As a direct consequence of its sheer size, in order to achieve even a minimum of efficiency, the state bureaucracy has to divide its work into clear-cut areas of competence, which are assigned to different departments. Within each department, there must be an accepted chain of command, and standard procedures have to be followed.</p>
<p>A coup operates by taking advantage of this machinelike behavior both during and after the takeover—during the coup because it uses parts of the state apparatus to seize the controlling levers over the rest, and afterward because the value of the levers depends on the degree to which the state really functions as a machine. (loc 375)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>some states are so well organized that the machine is sufficiently sophisticated to exercise discretion, according to a given conception of what is proper and what is not, in the orders that it executes. This is the case in the most advanced countries, and, in such circumstances, a coup is very difficult to carry out. In a few states, the bureaucracy is so small that the apparatus is too simple and too intimately linked with the leadership to allow room for a coup, as is still the case perhaps in the ex-British protectorates of southern Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. (loc 378)</p>

<p>Pronunciamiento This is an essentially Spanish and South American version of the military coup d’état, but many recent African coups have also taken this particular form. In its original nineteenth-century Spanish version, […] the pronunciamiento was organized and led by a particular army leader, but it was carried out in the name of the entire officer corps; unlike the putsch, which is carried out by a faction within the army, or the coup, which can also be executed by civilians using some army units, the pronunciamiento leads to a takeover by the army as a whole.

<p>while the political structures of all highly developed countries may seem too resilient to make them suitable targets, if acute enough, even temporary factors can weaken them fatally. Of those temporary factors, the most common are: (a) severe and prolonged economic crisis, with large-scale unemployment or runaway inflation; (b) a long and unsuccessful war or a major defeat, whether military or diplomatic; (c) chronic instability under a multiparty system.

<p>If we can set up efficient defensive roadblocks at the appropriate places, we should be able to deny their entry into the capital city for the short period required—that is, until we have established ourselves as the government and received the allegiance of the bulk of the state bureaucracy and military forces. Thus, by the time the forces of intervention have reached the scene of the action, they will be the isolated band of rebels. (loc 2561)</p>

<p>the formation of the large teams required by these targets will raise the delicate issue of the coup-within-the-coup danger. During the active phase of the coup, the situation will be confused and extremely unstable; while the other teams will be too small to tempt their leaders into trying to usurp our control, the operational leaders of the A-teams may well succumb to temptation. The man who leads the tanks that have just seized the presidential palace may easily persuade himself that he can also seize power on his own behalf, and if the A-team is sufficiently powerful, he may do just that.

<p>Until the actual execution of the coup, our aim was to destabilize the situation; afterward, however, all our efforts should be directed at stabilizing, or rather restabilizing, it. We will be doing this at three different levels: (a) among our own forces, where our aim is to prevent our military or police allies from usurping our leadership; (b) within the state bureaucracy, whose allegiance and cooperation we wish to secure; and (c) with the public at large, (loc 3249)</p>

<p>Economic development is generally regarded as “a good thing,” and almost everybody wants more of it, but for us—the newly established government of X-land—the pursuit of economic development will be undesirable because it militates against our main goal: political stability. (loc 3488)</p>

<p>It was precisely for the sake of better coordination in responding to the threat of North Korean commando attacks that the United States pressed the South Koreans to merge their Army Security Command, Navy Security Unit, and Air Force Office of Special Investigations into a single organization. A fully integrated, authentically joint Defense Security Command was ceremoniously inaugurated in October 1977. Two years later, its two-star commanding general, Chun Doo Hwan, used his fully unified command and monopoly of immediate force to seize power when the country’s president, Park Chung Hee, was assassinated.

<p>While the structures of political life under the Fourth Republic were falling apart, Charles de Gaulle, the grand heroic figure long in simulated retirement, gradually emerged as the only alternative to the chaos that threatened. When the army in Algeria appeared to be on the verge of truly drastic action and yet another government was on the verge of collapse, de Gaulle was recalled. He was able to impose his own terms. On May 29, 1958, when René Coty, the last president of the Fourth Republic, called on him to form a government (which was invested on June 1), de Gaulle was given extraordinary powers to rule by decree for six months and to write a new constitution.

<p>The existence of regional forces strong enough to control the supposed center may make a coup impossible. If the regional or ethnic bloc is organized along tribal lines, the structures of its leadership will be too firm and intimate for a coup to function from within. There has never been a coup in Lebanon, for example, because it is based on such an arrangement: the Shi‘a, Maronite Christian, Sunni Muslim, and Druze blocs are all mutually hostile, but they recognize the fact that no single group can hope to dominate all the others—not even Hezbollah, now the strongest by far. Thus, the Beirut government functions as a common clearinghouse for those policies that are accepted by each ethnic bloc. If one carried out a coup in Beirut, it would immediately lead to the collapse of the system, since each group, backed up by their own armed forces, would seize power in their own region. The coup would therefore only capture parts of Beirut and suburbs; it would probably be unable to retain control beyond that area. (loc 961)</p>

<p>In the early morning of April 23, 1961, elements of the First Foreign Legion Parachute Regiment seized the key points of the city of Algiers in the name of Generals Maurice Challe, André Zeller, Edmond Jouhaud, and Raoul Salan. The four generals, because of their personal prestige and their position in the French hierarchy, quickly asserted their control over the local military command and started to extend their authority over all the armed forces in Algeria.

<p>The French armed forces in Algeria were much more powerful than those stationed in France and Germany, and the four generals were hopeful that, once their allegiance was assured, they would find it easy to take effective control of the French government. (loc 2230)</p>

<p>The Duvalier mix of efficient repression, pervasive propaganda, and no economic development at all paid off: he lasted in power continuously for fourteen years, and was then followed by his son Jean Claude “Baby Doc,” who lasted fifteen more years. The Tonton Macoutes operated as a semipublic presidential guard and were able to add to their generous salaries by private exactions from the diminishing business sector. The propaganda machine, which involves ceremonial parades, laudatory films, and the projection of Papa Doc as a voodoo master, was almost as expensive to run as the Tonton Macoutes—but evidently useful.

<p>Their abject poverty was not entirely concealed by the exotic scenery; the almost complete absence of an educated class was brutally obvious. Yet, it was only a few right-wing extremists, and the still smaller number of old African hands, who argued that independence was being granted too soon. This small minority was easily dismissed as reactionary and racist. The enlightened knew better: the new states would muster the fresh energies of the peoples liberated from the lethargy of colonial rule; their youth would soon be educated to provide technicians, professionals, and civil servants; given some aid from the West, a great upsurge of economic development was to be expected, and this would soon remedy backwardness and the contrived poverty caused by colonial exploitation. More than that, we were told to look for moral leadership from the new states. (loc 188)</p>

<p>There was one thing that the new states lacked—something they could neither make for themselves nor obtain from abroad: this was a genuine political community. It is difficult to give a formal definition of political community. (loc 208)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The new states came into existence because the colonial authorities handed over their powers to political leaders who had agitated for independence; more specifically, the new leaders were given control over the army, police, tax collectors, and administrators who had worked for the colonial government. (loc 210)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>their [elements of state machinery] methods and their operational ideology were those of the imperial power—which were shaped by notions that reflected the values of its political community, including legality. There was no organic nexus between the native cultures and the instruments of state power, and neither could such a link be formed. (loc 213)</p>
<p><em>The machinery of a colonial state grants strong power to the colonist, but this is power based on the rule of law.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If colonialism were a crime, its greatest offense was its abrupt undoing. It left fragile native cultures, embryonic modern societies, and minority peoples utterly ill equipped to protect themselves when power was abandoned into the hands of political leaders armed with the powerful machine of the modern state. (loc 232)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The incompatibility between Islam and democracy—forever denied by the well meaning, forever reasserted in practice, and sometimes obscured by elections that may in themselves be perfectly free and fair—ensures the prevalence of authoritarian governments in most Muslim countries most of the time; quite a few are dynastic, with a self-perpetuating ruling family that monopolizes political power. That, in turn, ensures the passivity of the population in most places most of the time—Islam means “submission,” after all—barring the occasional revolts, soon suppressed in most cases. (loc 266)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Step-by-step guide to systematic futures trading]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the surface, <em>AFTS</em> is an easy book to be sceptical about – indeed, one <em>should</em> be sceptical about any book or course that offers “fully tested trading strategies”. But Carver’s experiences as a quant at AHL (a large hedge fund) and his many years of independent trading, not to mention a highly informative blog, were sufficient persuasion to read the book. I’m glad I did!</p>
<p><em>AFTS</em> is unique amongst quant books in that it describes a complete end-to-end system that I believe would give you at least a 0.5 Sharpe if you ran it live. Carver describes how he combines various trend and carry strategies to trade a portfolio of futures, while being clear-headed about the dangers of backtesting, and generally just demonstrating a lot of wisdom.</p>
<p>Separately, the book is excellent from a pedagogical perspective. The subtitle of the book says “30 fully tested strategies”, which might lead you to believe that you are going to get 30 disjoint chapters. Instead, each of the strategies illustrates important concepts which are necessary to understand the full trading system. For example, the first strategy is “buy and hold a single futures contract”, which might sound dumb, but it explains necessary subtleties of futures trading like contract rolling and price back-adjustment, without which one can scarcely hope to do anything fancier. Carver subsequently builds up to risk targeting, then uses trend following to illustrate continuous trading, before introducing other trading rules like carry.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a great book for people new to the industry or retail algo traders, as it introduces many concepts that are bread and butter in institutional trading but almost completely unknown outside of quant circles, for instance, continuous trading instead of discrete entry/exit criteria. Even for professionals, Carver provides a good review of standard tricks of the trade, intuition forged from many years of practical experience, and general inspiration – it is always useful to see how serious people in the business run their systems, even if one doesn’t agree with all their design decisions.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are either secure, anxious, or avoidant]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Attached</em> posits that the theory of childhood attachment can also be applied to study adult relationships. In essence, we are either secure, avoidant, or anxious, and this determines the structure of our romantic relationships. I have mixed feelings about the book.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I think it is a valuable attempt at providing an overarching schema to help us understand personality types in the context of relationships – a principal components analysis of the manifold drivers of relationship success and failure. This is useful because it gives someone a language to describe behavioural archetypes, or perhaps to introspect and understand their behavioural patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don’t think it’s a shocking thing to say that people are very complicated – there is not one single razor that can cut through the entire spectrum of relationship psychology. I feel that <em>Attached</em> overestimates the strength of its schema, which is particularly pernicious when it is making normative statements about what relationships <em>should</em> be like, and making value judgments about the different categories. For a book that claims that “your attachment needs are legitimate”, it sure has a lot of negative things to say about the non-secure categories.</p>
<p>So while I think it’s a beneficial book to read, one must exercise caution. It <em>is</em> useful to have a schema onto which you can pattern-match behaviour since it allows you to form priors about how you/others will behave or respond to a particular situation. But you need to quickly update these priors, and to internalise that attachment theory is only one lens for viewing relationships.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Core thesis</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Adults show patterns of attachment to their romantic partners similar to the patterns of attachment of children with their parents. (loc 113)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Attachment theory designates three main “attachment styles,” or manners in which people perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships, which parallel those found in children: Secure, Anxious, and Avoidant. Basically, secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving; anxious people crave intimacy, are often preoccupied with their relationships, and tend to worry about their partner’s ability to love them back; avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness. (loc 120)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Today, however, we know that attachment styles in adulthood are influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the way our parents cared for us, but other factors also come into play, including our genes and life experiences. (loc 143)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it’s not impossible for someone to change his or her attachment style—on average, one in four people do so over a four-year period (loc 162)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Bowlby proposed that throughout evolution, genetic selection favored people who became attached because it provided a survival advantage. (loc 173)</p>

<p>Don’t Lose Sight of These Facts:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Your attachment needs are legitimate.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">You shouldn’t feel bad for depending on the person you are closest to—it is part of your genetic makeup.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">A relationship, from an attachment perspective, should make you feel more self-confident and give you peace of mind. If it doesn’t, this is a wake-up call!</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">And above all, remain true to your authentic self—playing games will only distance you from your ultimate goal of finding true happiness, be it with your current partner or with someone else.<br>(loc 2968)</li>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Ideal relationships</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Attachment principles teach us that most people are only as needy as their unmet needs. When their emotional needs are met, and the earlier the better, they usually turn their attention outward. This is sometimes referred to in attachment literature as the “dependency paradox”: The more effectively dependent people are on one another, the more independent and daring they become. (loc 281)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The basic premise underlying this point of view is that the ideal relationship is one between two self-sufficient people who unite in a mature, respectful way while maintaining clear boundaries. If you develop a strong dependency on your partner, you are deficient in some way and are advised to work on yourself to become more “differentiated” and develop a “greater sense of self.” The worst possible scenario is that you will end up needing your partner, which is equated with “addiction” to him or her, and addiction, we all know, is a dangerous prospect. While the teachings of the codependency movement remain immensely helpful in dealing with family members who suffer from substance abuse (as was the initial intention), they can be misleading and even damaging when applied indiscriminately to all relationships (loc 337)</p>
<p><em>The book is essentially arguing against the “classical” view of self sufficiency.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>when two people form an intimate relationship, they regulate each other’s psychological and emotional well-being. Their physical proximity and availability influence the stress response. How can we be expected to maintain a high level of differentiation between ourselves and our partners if our basic biology is influenced by them to such an extent? (loc 359)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the ability to step into the world on our own often stems from the knowledge that there is someone beside us whom we can count on—and this is the “dependency paradox.” The logic of this paradox is hard to follow at first. How can we act more independent by being thoroughly dependent on someone else? If we had to describe the basic premise of adult attachment in a single sentence, it would be: If you want to take the road to independence and happiness, first find the right person to depend on and travel down it with them. (loc 377)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>having an attachment figure in the room was enough to allow a child to go out into a previously unknown environment and explore with confidence. This presence is known as a secure base. It is the knowledge that you are backed by someone who is supportive and whom you can rely on with 100 percent certainty and turn to in times of need. (loc 397)</p>

<p>I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. (Measure of the avoidant attachment style) (loc 313)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What’s wrong with me? I’m a smart, good-looking guy with a successful career. I have a lot to offer. I’ve dated some terrific women, but inevitably, after a few weeks I lose interest and start to feel trapped. It shouldn’t be this hard to find someone I’m compatible with. • I’ve (loc 63)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Avoidant: It is very important for you to maintain your independence and self-sufficiency and you often prefer autonomy to intimate relationships. Even though you do want to be close to others, you feel uncomfortable with too much closeness and tend to keep your partner at arm’s length. You don’t spend much time worrying about your romantic relationships or about being rejected. You tend not to open up to your partners and they often complain that you are emotionally distant. In relationships, you are often on high alert for any signs of control or impingement on your territory by your partner. (loc 497)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The experiments show that although you may be avoidant, your attachment “machinery” is still in place—making you just as vulnerable to threats of separation. Only when your mental energy is needed elsewhere and you are caught off guard, however, do these emotions and feelings emerge. (loc 1207)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One of the consequences of devaluing your romantic relationship is that you often wake up long after the relationship has gone stale, having forgotten all those negative things that annoyed you about your partner, wondering what went wrong and reminiscing longingly about your long-lost love. We call it the phantom-ex phenomenon. (loc 1336)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Partner is amazing, but as you start to get closer, you become overwhelmed with the feeling that s/he isn’t actually so hot after all? This can even happen after you’ve gone out with someone for a considerable amount of time or very intensively, all the while believing that s/he is the one, when all of a sudden you experience a chilling effect. You start to notice she has a weird way of eating, or that his nose blowing infuriates you. You end up discovering that after the initial exhilaration, you feel suffocated and need to take a step back. What you don’t realize is that this surge of negativity could in fact be a deactivating strategy, unconsciously triggered to turn off your attachment needs. (loc 1351)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Devaluing your partner when things become too close is very typical of people with an avoidant attachment style and is used as a way to create emotional distance. (loc 727)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Anxious attachment</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Someone with an anxious attachment style craves intimacy but is also very sensitive to even the smallest of perceived threats to this closeness. Sometimes they’ll interpret your unconscious actions as a threat to the relationship. When this happens, they become flooded with apprehension, but they lack the skills to communicate their distress to you effectively. Instead, they resort to a lot of acting out and drama. (loc 598)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>people with an anxious attachment style are indeed more vigilant to changes in others’ emotional expression and can have a higher degree of accuracy and sensitivity to other people’s cues. However, this finding comes with a caveat. The study showed that people with an anxious attachment style tend to jump to conclusions very quickly, and when they do, they tend to misinterpret people’s emotional state. (loc 794)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>they are often consumed with thoughts that have a single purpose: to reestablish closeness with their partner. These thoughts are called activating strategies. (loc 802)</p>

<p>Next time you date someone and find yourself feeling anxious, insecure, and obsessive—only to feel elated every once in a while—tell yourself this is most likely an activated attachment system and not love! (loc 950)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Secure attachment and becoming secure</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>there was no observed difference between secure couples and “mixed” couples— those with only one secure partner. (loc 1425)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>negative threatening themes didn’t get through to them as easily. However, unlike avoidants, who didn’t react to these words initially but did react to them when they were distracted by another task, secures continued to overlook them even in the distraction condition. Unlike people with an avoidant attachment style, secures aren’t concerned with threatening relationship thoughts even when they are caught off guard. In other words, they don’t have to make an effort to repress these ideas; they simply aren’t worried about these issues—either consciously or subconsciously! (loc 1461)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The good news is that people with a secure attachment style have healthy instincts and usually catch on very early that someone is not cut out to be their partner. The bad news is that when secure people do, on occasion, enter into a negative relationship, they might not know when to call it quits—especially if it’s a long-term, committed relationship in which they feel responsible for their partner’s happiness.

<p>We can tap into our attitudes toward our pets as a secure resource within us—we don’t assume our pets are doing things purposely to hurt us, we don’t hold grudges even when they eat something they shouldn’t or make a mess, we still greet them warmly when we come home (even after a rough day at the office), and we stick by them no matter what.

<p>If you are avoidant—the surefire sign that you need to use effective communication is when you feel an irrepressible need to bolt. Use effective communication to explain to your partner that you need some space and that you’d like to find a way of doing so that is acceptable to him or her. Suggest a few alternatives, making sure that the other person’s needs are taken care of. (loc 2509)</p>

<p>[Relationship Inventory technique]</p>
<p>Start by listing, in the left-hand column (1), the names of all your romantic partners, past and present. These can include people you’ve dated briefly. We suggest working vertically, one column at a time. Completing the inventory vertically encourages you to focus less on each particular scenario and to achieve an integrated picture of your working model across relationships. The more information you gather, the better. In column 2, write what you remember about the relationship: what it was like and what things stand out most when you try to recall your time together. Once you write down your general recollections of the relationship, column 3 allows you to take a closer look and identify specific scenarios that contribute to activation/deactivation of your attachment system. Column 4 asks how you responded to these situations: What did you do? What were you thinking? How did you feel? The lists below the inventory are provided to help you recall these reactions. Column 5 is a crucial next step. You will need to reassess these experiences from an attachment perspective to gain insight into the issues that affected your relationships. What attachment issues underlie your reactions: Protest behavior? Deactivation? Refer to the lists as a guide. In column 6, you’re asked to consider ways in which your reaction—now translated into attachment principles—hurts you and gets in the way of your happiness. Finally, column 7 prompts you to consider new, secure ways of handling these situations using a security-enhancing role model in your life and the secure principles we outline in this book (and in the box on page 174).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A schema for seducers]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cringe, I know. Before I start the review in earnest, let me say some things in my defence. Firstly, the sophisticated Greene reader appreciates that his books should not be treated as how-to guides, more so, they are courses in “applied history”, exploring the great characters of history via dramatised anecdotes and extracting lessons for the modern reader. Secondly, even if you use the books as guides, they can be used defensively rather than offensively – for example, students of <a href="/?books=the-48-laws-of-power" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The 48 Laws of Power</a> will presumably be better at spotting and avoiding Machiavellian characters around them. Lastly, on the matter of seduction itself, romantic seduction is merely one facet – perhaps the more impactful element is political mass seduction, which this book explores through characters like JFK, Napoleon, and Charles de Gaulle:</p>
<p>Having excused my choice of book, onto my review of <em>The Art of Seduction</em> . I think it’s mediocre, and certainly inferior to <a href="/?books=the-48-laws-of-power" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The 48 Laws of Power</a>. The case studies are repetitive, drawing from the lives of a narrow cohort of seducers, Lord Byron, D’Annunzio, and Casanova, whereas <em>The 48 Laws</em> has a rich arsenal of historical anecdotes with exciting breadth. Part Two, “The Seductive Process”, which lays out a step-by-step playbook for seduction, is rather bland and in any case far too long.</p>
<p>That said, Part One of the book is compelling – Greene creates a schema to classify types of seducers and types of “victims” of seduction. Rakes exude uncontrollable desire and passion – this characteristic helped Gabriele D’Annunzio seduce not only women, but politically seduce enough citizens and soldiers to stage a secession from Italy. Dandies cruise through life without respect for societal norms, and thus stir up attraction in people who feel constrained by society – take the story of Salomé, the woman who allegedly broke Nietzche’s heart. Coquettes seem unavailable and independent, embodying Proust’s remark “An absence, the declining of an invitation to dinner, an unintentional, unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world”.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>The 48 Laws</em> , many of the excerpts in <em>The Art of Seduction</em> are fictional, with numerous references to <em>The Tale of Genji</em>, Kierkegaard’s <em>Seducer’s Diary</em> , and Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> (which at times can be surprisingly raunchy!). Initially, I was disappointed by this, hoping for more of the historical anecdotes that made me enjoy <em>The 48 Laws.</em> But on reflection, seduction is naturally a more private affair than the exertion of power, and more concerned with subjective perception of reality, so it makes sense that it manifests more clearly in literature, wherein authors can deeply explore the psychological states of their characters.</p>
<p>All told, one can gain self-knowledge from this book (though not with the same density and incisiveness as <em>The 48 Laws</em> ), so it is probably worth reading. But treat it as a history of seducers and/or a literary survey of seduction, rather than a normative guide on how you should behave.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A troubled chess master’s creeping descent into madness]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was intrigued by the blurb for <em>The Luzhin Defense</em>: a troubled chess master’s creeping descent into madness. Because of Nabokov’s talent for unsettling portrayals of insanity, exemplified by Kinbote in <em>Pale Fire</em> , and my hobby interest in chess, my expectations were high.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to these lofty expectations, the novel fell short for me. It fluctuates between overly subtle imagery, such as the recurrent “black and white” motifs hinting at a chessboard, and overly explicit elements, like Luzhin&#39;s chess-themed dreams and the transformation of objects around him into chess pieces.</p>
<p>Once you abstract beyond the particularities of the protagonist’s obsession with chess, the novel’s strengths emerge – the nature of all-consuming obsession, and the pathos of his wife’s support for Luzhin’s single-minded pursuit of greatness, despite not truly understanding the nature of what he is pursuing.</p>
<p>Nabokov felt that <em>The Luzhin Defense</em> “contains and diffuses the greatest warmth” of his early novels. I guess I can’t justifiably disagree with this because I haven’t read his other Russian works, but if we expand the field to his later corpus, I find it hard to rank <em>The Luzhin Defense</em> above <em>Pnin</em> and <a href="/?books=the-real-life-of-sebastian-knight" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</a>.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>With the revolution it was even worse. The general opinion was that it had influenced the course of every Russian’s life; an author could not have his hero go through it without getting scorched, and to dodge it was impossible. This amounted to a genuine violation of the writer’s free will. Actually, how could the revolution affect his son? On the long-awaited day in the fall of nineteen hundred and seventeen Valentinov appeared, just as cheerful, loud and magnificently dressed as before, and behind him was a pudgy young man with a rudimentary mustache. There was a moment of sorrow, embarrassment and strange disillusionment. The son hardly spoke and kept glancing askance at the window (loc 860)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>she was twenty-five, her fashionably bobbed hair was neat and lovely and she had one turn of the head which betrayed a hint of possible harmony, a promise of real beauty that at the last moment remained unfulfilled. (loc 924)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Luzhin’s present plight was that of a writer or composer who, having assimilated the latest things in art at the beginning of his active career and caused a temporary sensation with the originality of his devices, all at once notices that a change has imperceptibly taken place around him, that others, sprung from goodness knows where, have left him behind in the very devices where he recently led the way, and then he feels himself robbed, sees only ungrateful imitators in the bold artists who have overtaken him, and seldom understands that he himself is to blame, he who has petrified in his art which was once new but has not advanced since then. (loc 1061)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It was then that she realized clearly that this man, whether you liked him or not, was not one you could thrust out of your life, that he had sat himself down firmly, solidly and apparently for a long time. But she also wondered how she could show this man to her father and mother, how could he be visualized in their drawing room—a man of a different dimension, with a particular form and coloring that was compatible with nothing and no one. (loc 1138)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>to hold her on his lap was nothing compared to the certainty that she would follow him and not disappear, like certain dreams that suddenly burst and disperse because the gleaming dome of the alarm clock has floated up through them. With one shoulder pressed against his chest she tried with a cautious finger to raise his eyelids a little higher and the slight pressure on his eyeball caused a strange black light to leap there, to leap like his black Knight which simply took the Pawn if Turati moved it out on the seventh move, as he had done at their last meeting. The Knight, of course, perished, but this loss was recompensed with a subtle attack by black and here the chances were on his side. (loc 1287)</p>
<p><em>Segments like this are among the highlights of the book, where his trains of thoughts suddenly veer into chess.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the moon emerged from behind the angular black twigs, a round, full-bodied moon—a vivid confirmation of victory—and when finally Luzhin left the balcony and stepped back into his room, there on the floor lay an enormous square of moonlight, and in that light—his own shadow. (loc 1293)</p>
<p><em>Luzhin resembling a chess piece on the board</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Having stamped out a shadow in one place, Luzhin saw with despair that far from where he was sitting a new combination was taking shape on the floor. “If you are in the least interested in my opinion then I must tell you I consider this match ridiculous. You probably think my husband will support you. Admit it: you do think that?” “I am in straitened circumstances,” said Luzhin. “I would need very little. And a magazine has offered me to edit its chess section …” Here the nuisances on the floor became so brazen that Luzhin involuntarily put out a hand to remove shadow’s King from the threat of light’s Pawn. (loc 1414)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The whole time, however, now feebly, now sharply, shadows of his real chess life would show through this dream and finally it broke through and it was simply night in the hotel, chess thoughts, chess insomnia and meditations on the drastic defense he had invented to counter Turati’s opening. He was wide-awake and his mind worked clearly, purged of all dross and aware that everything apart from chess was only an enchanting dream, in which, like the golden haze of the moon, the image of a sweet, clear-eyed maiden with bare arms dissolved and melted. (loc 1485)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beautiful, surprising adaptation of a classic.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Proust, with his wandering reminiscences, endless tangents, and expansive non-linear storylines, hardly seems like the ideal candidate for adaptation into a graphic novel. Yet, Stéphane Heuet, with Arthur Goldhammer’s masterful translation, has succeeded in capturing both the intellectual and emotional essence of Proust, creating an utterly enchanting classic in its own right.</p>
<p>Heuet humanises what is a genuinely difficult (yet entirely worthwhile) text, with charming images of the young narrator, wistful depictions of the childhood town of Combray, and scathing caricatures of the socialite Verdurins. Monsieur Swann comes alive – his grace and elegance, but also the deep pathos from his troubled relationship with Odette de Crécy.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of this exists in more depth and abstraction in the original novel, with Proust’s famously long sentences giving him endless scope to delve into his consciousness and explore the nuances of his memory. However, Goldhammer has done an admirable job in abridging the original text – his translation captures the exquisite ideas in manageable sentences that don’t run for several pages.</p>
<p>For me, reading this adaptation was a Proustian experience in itself. It transported me back to those bleak days on an army base, almost seven years ago to the day, getting lost in the novel as an escape from reality. It was strangely warming to see that some of the passages I highlighted on this reading were the same ones that captivated me all those years ago. I felt a spark of empathy for my younger self, which I often suppress, and gently reflected on my growth, defining moments, and most memorable experiences – my own <em>recherche de temps perdu</em> .</p>
<p>A refreshed review of the original novel is in the works!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satire on everlasting love, or a grim portrait of its reality?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em> is a complex novel about love, marriage, and romance: the medley of the three, their contradictions, and how they interact with society. I’ve been chewing on this one, and truthfully I’m still not sure what to make of it.</p>
<p>Nominally, it is a romantic novel about a man who waits half a century to reunite with his true love, after being separated by a father who insists that his daughter marries into a good family:</p>
<p>But Marquez quickly shatters the fairytale. As we journey back through their lives, the youthful romance’s impulsive nature unravels into complexity and ambiguity.</p>
<p>One can read the novel as a satire, challenging the notion of everlasting love. Florentino convinces himself that he is being intellectually pure and true to Fermina, while becoming a serial philanderer who callously discards women when they become inconvenient; the notably tragic conclusion of his affair with a 14-year-old girl is damning. Fermina, for her part, is trapped in a marriage which oscillates between quiet contentment and conjugal purgatory, despite looking perfectly pleasant on the outside. Marquez gives voice to the quiet plight of women in traditional marriages – the almost dehumanising way in which they exist solely in service to their husbands:</p>
<p>But this interpretation undersells the depth of the novel. The omniscient narrator does not present any of Florentino’s affairs with judgment. On the contrary, we see that Florentino is also being used by the women and that he suffers from the accumulated weight of his love for them. This reminds me of a core theme from the film <em>Her</em> – the “divisibility” of love. For Florentino, as it was for Samantha (the AI voiced by Scarlett Johansen), love is not a finite pie that gets split between people. Instead, it is a messy Venn diagram.</p>
<p>Similarly, Fermina’s marriage is presented in shades of grey. While she is sometimes portrayed as feeling trapped, Marquez explores the subtle joys in her marriage to the kind, noble, but imperfect Urbino.</p>
<p>The book is a long read, and at times it feels repetitive. But much like <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> , this repetition has a purpose, like the motif in a fugue. Florentino’s affairs are not independent events – each is a part of his self-discovery as he understands more about the nature of romance and companionship, slowly reaching enlightenment. The ultimate reunion with Fermina is gentle and mature, in stark contrast to the fiery romance of their youth. All said, <em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em> succeeds as a meditation on the nature of love and the longing heart: the idealism and the hedonism; the nobility and the hypocrisy; the excitement and the desperation.</p>

<p>her heart jumped inside her ribs when she saw her man lying on his back in the mud, dead to this life but still resisting death’s final blow for one last minute so that she would have time to come to him. He recognized her despite the uproar, through his tears of unrepeatable sorrow at dying without her, and he looked at her for the last and final time with eyes more luminous, more grief-stricken, more grateful than she had ever seen them in half a century of a shared life, and he managed to say to her with his last breath: “Only God knows how much I loved you.” (loc 743)</p>

<p>He was aware that he did not love her. He had married her because he liked her haughtiness, her seriousness, her strength, and also because of some vanity on his part, but as she kissed him for the first time he was sure there would be no obstacle to their inventing true love. They did not speak of it that first night, when they spoke of everything until dawn, nor would they ever speak of it. But in the long run, neither of them had made a mistake. (loc 2729)</p>

<p>she was something she never dared admit even to herself: a deluxe servant. In society she came to be the woman most loved, most catered to, and by the same token most feared, but in nothing was she more demanding or less forgiving than in the management of her house. She always felt as if her life had been lent to her by her husband: she was absolute monarch of a vast empire of happiness, which had been built by him and for him alone. She knew that he loved her above all else, more than anyone else in the world, but only for his own sake: she was in his holy service. (loc 3788)</p>

<p>The world became a hell for him. For once the initial madness was sated, they both became aware of the risks involved, and Dr. Juvenal Urbino never had the resolve to face a scandal. In the deliriums of passion he promised everything, but when it was over, everything was left for later. On the other hand, as his desire to be with her grew, so did his fear of losing her, so that their meetings became more and more hurried and problematic. He thought about nothing else. He waited for the afternoons with unbearable longing, he forgot his other commitments, he forgot everything but her, but as his carriage approached the Mala Crianza salt marsh he prayed to God that an unforeseen obstacle would force it to drive past.

<p>The last thing Miss Lynch received from him was an emerald tiara in a little box wrapped in paper from the pharmacy, so that the coachman himself thought it was an emergency prescription and handed it to her with no comment, no message, nothing in writing. Dr. Urbino never saw her again, not even by accident, and God alone knows how much grief his heroic resolve cost him or how many bitter tears he had to shed behind the locked lavatory door in order to survive this private catastrophe.

<p>it was not her memory alone that accompanied him to the party Leona Cassiani gave for him that night. The memory of them all was with him: those who slept in the cemeteries, thinking of him through the roses he planted over them, as well as those who still laid their heads on the pillow where their husbands slept, their horns golden in the moonlight. Deprived of one, he wanted to be with them all at the same time, which is what he always wanted whenever he was fearful. For even during his most difficult times and at his worst moments, he had maintained some link, no matter how weak, with his countless lovers of so many years: he always kept track of their lives.

<p>Florentino Ariza learned what he had already experienced many times without realizing it: that one can be in love with several people at the same time, feel the same sorrow with each, and not betray any of them. Alone in the midst of the crowd on the pier, he said to himself in a flash of anger: “My heart has more rooms than a whorehouse.” He wept copious tears at the grief of parting. But as soon as the ship had disappeared over the horizon, the memory of Fermina Daza once again occupied all his space. (loc 4650)</p>

<p>His natural gallantry and languid manner were immediately charming, but they were also considered suspect virtues in a confirmed bachelor. He had spent a great deal of money, ingenuity, and willpower to disguise the seventy-six years he had completed in March, and he was convinced in the solitude of his soul that he had loved in silence for a much longer time than anyone else in this world ever had. (loc 843)</p>

<p>Florentino Ariza developed methods that seemed incredible in someone like him, taciturn and thin and dressed like an old man from another time. He had two advantages working in his favor, however. One was an unerring eye that promptly spotted the woman, even in a crowd, who was waiting for him, though even then he courted her with caution, for he felt that nothing was more embarrassing or more demeaning than a refusal. The other was that women promptly identified him as a solitary man in need of love, a street beggar as humble as a whipped dog, who made them yield without conditions, without asking him for anything, without hoping for anything from him except the tranquillity of knowing they had done him a favor. (loc 2601)</p>

<p>In the plenitude of their relationship, Florentino Ariza had asked himself which of the two was love: the turbulent bed or the peaceful Sunday afternoons, and Sara Noriega calmed him with the simple argument that love was everything they did naked. (loc 3396)</p>

<p>On the Pentecost Sunday when Juvenal Urbino died, he had only one left, only one, who had just turned fourteen and had everything that no one else until then had had to make him mad with love. Her name was América Vicuña. She had arrived two years before from the fishing village of Puerto Padre, entrusted by her family to Florentino Ariza as her guardian and recognized blood relative.

<p><em>It is hard to know how to interpet the América Vicuña romance – from what I gather, in the novel’s setting of the early 20th century, many regions had a legal marriage age of as young as 14.

<p>Then Florentino Ariza knew that some night, sometime in the future, in a joyous bed with Fermina Daza, he was going to tell her that he had not revealed the secret of his love, not even to the one person who had earned the right to know it. No: he would never reveal it, not even to Leona Cassiani, not because he did not want to open the chest where he had kept it so carefully hidden for half his life, but because he realized only then that he had lost the key.

<p>he knew that any conventional slip, the slightest nostalgic indiscretion, could revive the unpleasant taste of the past in her heart, and although he foresaw her returning a hundred letters to him before she dared open the first, he preferred that it not happen even once. And so he planned everything down to the last detail, as if it were the final battle: new intrigues, new hopes in a woman who had already lived a full and complete life. It had to be a mad dream, one that would give her the courage she would need to discard the prejudices of a class that had not always been hers but had become hers more than anyone’s. It had to teach her to think of love as a state of grace: not the means to anything but the alpha and omega, an end in itself. (loc 5030)</p>

<p>By the time she had emptied the teapot and he the coffeepot, they had both attempted and then broken off several topics of conversation, not so much because they were really interested in them but in order to avoid others that neither dared to broach. They were both intimidated, they could not understand what they were doing so far from their youth on a terrace with checkerboard tiles in a house that belonged to no one and that was still redolent of cemetery flowers.

<p>She began to speak of her dead husband in the present tense, as if he were alive, and Florentino Ariza knew then that for her, too, the time had come to ask herself with dignity, with majesty, with an irrepressible desire to live, what she should do with the love that had been left behind without a master.

<p>they no longer felt like newlyweds, and even less like belated lovers. It was as if they had leapt over the arduous calvary of conjugal life and gone straight to the heart of love. They were together in silence like an old married couple wary of life, beyond the pitfalls of passion, beyond the brutal mockery of hope and the phantoms of disillusion: beyond love. For they had lived together long enough to know that love was always love, anytime and anyplace, but it was more solid the closer it came to death. (loc 5954)</p>

<p>they had seen each other for what they were: two old people, ambushed by death, who had nothing in common except the memory of an ephemeral past that was no longer theirs but belonged to two young people who had vanished and who could have been their grandchildren.

<p>She reminded him that the weak would never enter the kingdom of love, which is a harsh and ungenerous kingdom, and that women give themselves only to men of resolute spirit, who provide the security they need in order to face life. Florentino Ariza learned the lesson, perhaps too well. Tránsito Ariza could not hide a feeling of pride, more carnal than maternal, when she saw him leave the notions shop in his black suit and stiff felt hat, his lyrical bow tie and celluloid collar, and she asked him as a joke if he was going to a funeral.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Created, but did not perfect, the genre of dystopian fiction]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>We</em> has a reasonable claim to being one of the most important novels of the 20th century, in that it essentially invented the genre of dystopian fiction. Orwell explicitly pointed to <em>We</em> as the model for <em>1984</em> (which he started writing less than a year after reading <em>We</em> ), and as Vonnegut says: “<em>Player Piano</em> cheerfully ripped off the plot of <em>Brave New World</em> whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from <em>We</em> .”</p>
<p><em>We</em> is set in the dystopian OneState, where all the “numbers” in society live (citizens are given numbers rather than names), in glass apartments, according to strict centrally-determined schedules. The secret police, referred to lovingly as the Bureau of Guardians, periodically root out and publicly execute any deviants, in a cheerful spectacle of civil unity.</p>
<p><em>We</em> is a somewhat difficult book to enjoy. It is emotionless and full of bland mathematical metaphors that quickly exhaust the reader. Of course, this is largely by design, as the book is an epistolary novel written from the perspective of a mathematician in OneState, where homogeneity is enforced and imagination is discouraged. But I think this is a bit of a cop-out from the author – Nabokov is an excellent example of an author who can wear different metafictional hats without sacrificing the quality of the prose.</p>
<p>As far as the dystopian commentary goes, the book doesn’t leave much to the imagination. It is heavy-handed and overall less philosophical than later classic dystopian novels. For example, the protagonist’s “awakening” is largely precipitated by – I apologise for being crass – “tiddies and booze”. Granted, love is also the trigger in <em>1984</em> and <em>Brave New World</em> , but those feel like they have more substance, whereas the protagonist of <em>We</em> falls in love with I-330 based on her physique and her yellow dress.</p>
<p>In fairness, <em>We</em> does contain some fascinating commentary on the role of religion in the state, which is quite orthogonal to later works (though the reader really has to work for this, as it is discussed obliquely, in broken phrases). Zamyatin implies that the OneState is satisfying the Christian ideal of the divine afterlife – endless bliss, oneness with God, and freedom from choice: “In paradise they’ve lost all knowledge of desires, pity, love – they are blessed, with their imaginations surgically removed (the only reason why they are blessed) – angels the slaves of god…”. By comparison, the authoritarian states in <em>Brave New World</em> and <em>1984</em> both explicitly ban religion.</p>
<p>All said, I think there is a fairly general concept where the original creator/discoverer of an idea is seldom the one who perfectly understands it (this crops up a lot in physics, for example with Einstein and quantum mechanics). The creator is either too attached to the previous paradigm in the Kuhnian sense, or their initial confirmation bias prevents them from fully exploring the implications of their idea. It’s the same here. I can’t deny the influence that <em>We</em> has had on the development of dystopian fiction as a genre, But in my mind, <em>We</em> remains one tier below the classic dystopian novels that it inspired, notably the classic trio: <em>1984, Brave New World</em>, and<em>Fahrenheit 451</em> .</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>It is for you to place the beneficial yoke of reason round the necks of the unknown beings who inhabit other planets – still living, it may be, in the primitive state known as freedom. If they will not understand that we are bringing them a mathematically infallible happiness, we shall be obliged to force them to be happy.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Closer – she leaned against me with her shoulder, and we made one, she blended into me – and I knew: This is how it has to be. I knew this with every never, every hair, with every sweet pain of every heartbeat. And what a joy it was to give in to this <em>has to be</em> . A piece of iron probably feels just as glad to submit to the precise, inevitable law and clamp onto a magnet. A stone thrown up in the air hesitates for a moment and then plunges down headlong to the earth. And after the final agony a man is glad to breathe his last – and die.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>They say there are flowers that bloom only once every hundred years. Why shouldn’t there be some that bloom only once every thousand, every ten thousand years? Maybe we just haven’t heard about them up to now because this very day is that once-in-a-thousand-years.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Look – there are two forces in the world, entropy and energy. One of them leads to blissful tranquillity, to happy equilibrium. The other leads to the disruption of the equilibrium, to the torment of perpetual movement.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Do you believe that you will die? Yes, man is mortal, I am a man, ergo… No that isn’t what I mean. I know that you know that. What I’m asking is: Have you ever actually <em>believed</em> it, believed it completely, believed not with your mind but with your <em>body</em>, actually felt that one day the fingers now holding this very piece of paper will be yellow and icy…? No, of course you don’t believe it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[The Benefactor]</p>
<p>What is it that people beg for, dream about, torment themselves for, from the time they leave swaddling clothes? They want someone to tell them, once and for all, what happiness is – and then to bind them to that happiness with a chain. What is it we’re doing right now, if not that? The ancient dream of paradise… Remember: In paradise they’ve lost all knowledge of desires, pity, love – they are blessed, with their imaginations surgically removed (the only reason why they are blessed) – angels the slaves of god…</p>
<p><em>OneState is almost a religious entity</em></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Geist has been driving us towards self-knowledge]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Around 600 BC, carved into the temple of Apollo at Delphi, were three maxims: know thyself, nothing in excess, surety brings ruin. There was also an enigmatic letter <em>E</em>, whose meaning is a puzzle for modern scholars, as it was for Plutarch in the first century AD.</p>
<p>We don’t actually know any of this for certain; the temple was destroyed in AD 390 at the order of the Roman emperor Theodosius I. Instead, we must rely on the references to the maxims by the great minds of antiquity, who were doing the same thing that I am now – reflecting on the statements and trying to use them to live a better life.</p>
<p>Wilkins’ <em>The Delphic Maxims in Literature</em> is a study of the history of the maxims and the evolution of thought around them. The second and third are given one chapter apiece: “nothing in excess” was relatively unambiguous and similar to other sayings du jour that encouraged moderation; “surety brings ruin” has been variously translated and was interpreted very differently by the Greeks (danger of overconfidence) and the Romans, the latter of whom had the more prosaic interpretation that we should avoid giving financial guarantees (or even that we should avoid pledging ourselves in marriage!).</p>
<p>The majority of the book is rightfully devoted to <em>gnothi seauton</em> – know thyself – which reflects the relative importance of that first maxim to literary and philosophical minds over three millennia. Wilkins explores the subtle evolution in interpretation over the centuries, from the individualistic self-knowledge of the Greeks (knowing strengths and weaknesses) to the more holistic and humanist understanding encouraged by thinkers in the 18th century. I am deeply reminded of Hegel’s philosophy of history, wherein the intellectual soul of humanity (the <em>geist</em> ) is yearning to grow its rationality, freedom, and power, and trying to approach ultimate self-consciousness – the “becoming of Man”.</p>
<p>My preferred interpretations of the three maxims are as follows:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Know Thyself: understand your motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. Be conscious and deliberate.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Nothing too much: “everything in moderation, including moderation”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Surety brings ruin: avoid overconfidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wilkins also discusses how this self-knowledge may be achieved, beautifully summarising it thus:</p>
<p><em>The Delphic Maxims in Literature</em> is hard to recommend as it is rather arcane, with many references to obscure authors whose literary importance may have waned to nothingness in the century since Wilkins wrote his treatise. But in one’s quest for self-knowledge, it is heartening to know that one is in the company of many of the great minds from history.</p>

        <updated>2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Equilibrium thinking is unintuitive ]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Economics in One Lesson</em> is a manifesto for classical economics, championing free markets and general equilibrium. The title is not an exaggeration, Hazlitt really does boil down his economic philosophy into one lesson: “the art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups”. This lesson seems like generally good advice that theoretically should be agnostic to the underlying economic philosophy, but when interpreted by Hazlitt, this lesson always seems to favour the libertarian solution.</p>
<p>Hazlitt espouses the Austrian economic notion that deduction and “common sense” reasoning are key tools in the economist’s arsenal. Purely empirical analysis, in his opinion, often neglects the long-term and more diffuse consequences, which may be more impactful.</p>
<p>Some of his arguments are insightful, especially for someone without a formal economics background. For example, he convincingly argues that war is a bad thing economically, which despite sounding like common sense, is not necessarily a common take from economic pundits – some posit that war increases labour and consumption, but Hazlitt quite sensibly counters that war creates “need” rather than “demand”, and that destruction decreases the purchasing power of people whose property has been destroyed. He does note one counterpoint, which is that wartime technological advancement may indeed increase productivity, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p>However, the book often descends into rhetoric and armchair economics, particularly in his criticism of government intervention in the free market. While I have an enormous amount of respect for the market mechanism, I think it is a midwit take to assume that it can solve all of our problems. The role of the government, in my mind, is to nudge us away from “inadequate Nash equilibria” by changing collective utility functions. Individual utility maximisation can get you quite far, but given the particular idiosyncrasies of our utility functions (the S-curve, bounded rationality, dependence on neighbours’ utility functions), I think it’s quite obvious that there are situations where everything can break down in a crisis of confidence. For instance, when arguing against government lending, he says: “government lenders will take risks with [taxpayer’s money] that private lenders will not take with their own money”. Correct! That’s a feature, not a bug – the government <em>should</em> make societal +EV bets that individuals are unwilling to. It is, of course, valid to question the practical execution ability of the government… but for that, you would likely have to turn to empirical data, which Hazlitt is loath to do as a staunch Austrian.</p>
<p>In giving the below criticism of Keynes, it feels like the point has been missed and he is attacking a strawman:</p>
<p>With the quip “in the long run we are all dead”, I don’t believe Keynes is literally arguing that we should ignore the long-run effects, rather, that classical economics seldom considers the time lags required for the free market to work its wonders of redistribution.</p>
<p>Despite all my above criticisms, I partially agree with the Austrian notion that we can’t rely purely on empiricism, given the difficulties of measurement – we must meld that with logical argumentation. Hazlitt does make testable predictions: for example, he argues that setting a price cap on commodities (a solution that governments turn to time and time again during food and energy crises), discourages production and ultimately raises prices further. This is exactly what happened, 24 years after the initial publication of the book, during Nixon’s 1970s price caps.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is a more valuable read than I first gave it credit for. If you take everything with a pinch of salt and treat it as a clear elucidation of the Austrian view, the applications of the “lesson” are quite instructive. Finally, I enjoyed Hazlitt’s discussion of the fundamental difficulties in economic philosophy – special interest groups advocate for the economic schools that serve their own interests.

<p>This book is an analysis of economic fallacies that are at last so prevalent that they have almost become a new orthodoxy. The one thing that has prevented this has been their own self-contradictions, which have scattered those who accept the same premises into a hundred different “schools,” for the simple reason that it is impossible in matters touching practical life to be consistently wrong.

<p>the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences. (loc 102)</p>

<p>There are men regarded today as brilliant economists, who deprecate saving and recommend squandering on a national scale as the way of economic salvation; and when anyone points to what the consequences of these policies will be in the long run, they reply flippantly, as might the prodigal son of a warning father: “In the long run we are all dead.” And such shallow wisecracks pass as devastating epigrams and the ripest wisdom. But the tragedy is that, on the contrary, we are already suffering the long-run consequences of the policies of the remote or recent past. Today is already the tomorrow which the bad economist yesterday urged us to ignore. (loc 114)</p>

<p>the whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single sentence. The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups. (loc 122)</p>

<p>It is often complained that demagogues can be more plausible in putting forward economic nonsense from the platform than the honest men who try to show what is wrong with it. But the basic reason for this ought not to be mysterious. The reason is that the demagogues and bad economists are presenting half-truths. They are speaking only of the immediate effect of a proposed policy or its effect upon a single group. As far as they go they may often be right. (loc 141)</p>

<p>When they say that the way to economic salvation is to increase credit, it is just as if they said that the way to economic salvation is to increase debt: these are different names for the same thing seen from opposite sides. (loc 2560)</p>

<p>the student whose aim is to attain as much truth as possible […] will not be forever seeking a revolution, a “fresh start,” in economic thought. His mind will, of course, be as receptive to new ideas as to old ones; but he will be content to put aside merely restless or exhibitionistic straining for novelty and originality. As Morris R. Cohen has remarked: “The notion that we can dismiss the views of all previous thinkers surely leaves no basis for the hope that our own work will prove of any value to others.” (loc 55)</p>

<p>The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine—the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. […]</p>
<p>The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for them plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible. (loc 98)</p>

<p>The deductive side of economics is no less important than the factual. One can say of it what Santayana says of logic (and what could be equally well said of mathematics), that it “traces the radiation of truth,” so that “when one term of a logical system is known to describe a fact, the whole system attaching to that term becomes, as it were, incandescent.” (loc 2556)</p>

<p>[Does breaking a window create productivity]</p>
<p>The crowd is at least right in its first conclusion. This little act of vandalism will in the first instance mean more business for some glazier. The glazier will be no more unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death. But the shopkeeper will be out $250 that he was planning to spend for a new suit. Because he has had to replace a window, he will have to go without the suit (or some equivalent need or luxury). (loc 167)</p>

<p>confused need with demand. The more war destroys, the more it impoverishes, the greater is the postwar need. Indubitably. But need is not demand.

<p>Wherever business was increased in one direction, it was (except insofar as productive energies were stimulated by a sense of want and urgency) correspondingly reduced in another.

<p>A bridge is built. If it is built to meet an insistent public demand, if it solves a traffic problem or a transportation problem otherwise insoluble, if, in short, it is even more necessary to the taxpayers collectively than the things for which they would have individually spent their money if it had not been taxed away from them, there can be no objection.

<p>There is a strange idea abroad, held by all monetary cranks, that credit is something a banker gives to a man. Credit, on the contrary, is something a man already has. He has it, perhaps, because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned it. He brings it into the bank with him. That is why the banker makes him the loan. (loc 434)</p>

<p>What possible point can there be, he is likely to ask, in discussing refinements and advances in economic theory, when popular thought and the actual policies of governments, certainly in everything connected with international relations, have not yet caught up with Adam Smith? For present-day tariff and trade policies are not only as bad as those in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but incomparably worse. (loc 842)</p>

<p>the added amount which consumers pay for a tariff-protected article leaves them just that much less with which to buy all other articles. There is here no net gain to industry as a whole. But as a result of the artificial barrier erected against foreign goods, American labor, capital and land are deflected from what they can do more efficiently to what they do less efficiently. Therefore, as a result of the tariff wall, the average productivity of American labor and capital is reduced. (loc 919)</p>

<p>The effect of a tariff, therefore, is to change the structure of American production.

<p>Rent control is initially imposed on the argument that the supply of housing is not “elastic”—i.e., that a housing shortage cannot be immediately made up, no matter how high rents are allowed to rise.

<p>If landlords are allowed to raise rents to reflect a monetary inflation and the true conditions of supply and demand, individual tenants will economize by taking less space.

<p>“Saving” in short, in the modern world, is only another form of spending [because the money in a bank is lent out]. The usual difference is that the money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to increase production. (loc 2358)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Mere hoarding of hand-to-hand money, if it takes place irrationally, causelessly, and on a large scale, is in most economic situations harmful. But this sort of hoarding is extremely rare. (loc 2371)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This hoarding of cash may seem like a cause of a subsequent slowdown in business activity. The real cause, however, is the uncertainty brought about by the government policies. The larger cash balances of firms and individuals are merely one link in the chain of consequences from that uncertainty. To blame “excessive saving” for the business decline would be like blaming a fall in the price of apples not on a bumper crop but on the people who refuse to pay more for apples. (loc 2387)</p>
<p><em>This is very weak. He is conceding that the hoarding of cash is directly causal (if not at the root of the causal chain)… so discouraging hoarding is a valid (and possibly most proximal) solution.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If interest rates are artificially kept too low in relation to risks, there will be a reduction in both saving and lending. (loc 2454)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>while new injections of currency or bank credit can at first, and temporarily, bring about lower interest rates, persistence in this device must eventually raise interest rates. It does so because new injections of money tend to lower the purchasing power of money. Lenders then come to realize that the money they lend today will buy less a year from now, say, when they get it back. Therefore to the normal interest rate they add a premium to compensate them for this expected loss in their money’s purchasing power. This premium can be high, depending on the extent of the expected inflation. Thus the annual interest rate on British treasury bills rose to 14 percent in 1976; Italian government bonds yielded 16 percent in 1977; and the discount rate of the central bank of Chile soared to 75 percent in 1974.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extraordinary talent born at the right time]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David Bell offers a succinct overview of the remarkable life of Napoleon, highlighting the most important aspects of his character, the critical historical events, and his enduring legacy. I have great respect for historians who are able to part with the minutiae and distil the key concepts for non-historians like me – as Bell writes in the introduction, “while the current crop of biographies has many virtues, concision is not among them”.</p>
<p>I was particularly impressed that, despite the emphasis on brevity, Bell not only narrates Napoleon’s life but advances a thesis of the historical circumstances that made Napoleon possible. He believes that while Napoleon was indeed a man of great talent (exceptionally intelligent, industrious, and politically savvy), his rise was catalysed by the social tumult of the French Revolution (”chaos is a ladder”), the newly-free press, and the evolution of warfare. For example, Napoleon was a master of the media, carefully managing his image and using the press to rally the populous, a tactic that has been repeated many times in history: Mussolini and Nasser with radio, the Nazis with film, Khomeini and the cassette tapes, etc.</p>
<p>The biography is well-written – the language is pretty without being ornate – and within the constraint of concision, Bell does a commendable job of introducing other characters and themes. I now want to read more about Talleyrand, who was Napoleon’s foreign minister for a time, before ultimately resigning and plotting against Napoleon. Notably, Talleyrand features more in <a href="/?books=the-48-laws-of-power" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The 48 Laws of Power</a> than Napoleon!</p>
<p>Napoleon is certainly not presented as a role model, especially with his general disregard for human life (“A man like me troubles himself little about a million men”), but Bell does not think he is a tyrant either, especially when compared to 20th-century fascist leaders. Moral considerations aside, in my eyes the principal value of his story (and the story of other “Great Men” like Churchill, Alexander the Great, and Caesar Augustus), is to make us dramatically expand our view of what is achievable in a lifetime.</p>

<p>I argue that the immense political upheaval of the French Revolution, and the emergence of newly intense forms of European warfare, reinforced each other in a strikingly powerful and original manner that made Napoleon possible. He, in turn, tried—and ultimately failed—to forge a regime that based its legitimacy on the revolutionary principles of popular sovereignty and civic equality, but also on personal charisma and military glory. (loc 73)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He is, after all, the man who, born in obscurity, acquired the greatest military reputation of any European military commander in centuries while still in his twenties. At thirty he ruled France, and at forty he dominated Europe as no individual had since Charlemagne—perhaps, indeed, since the Caesars. (loc 97)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Napoleon orders his own men to lower their weapons. An aide protests, but he insists. He steps forward, out in front of his own troops, to within twenty feet of the royalist regiment. “Soldiers of the Fifth!” he cries out to them. “I am your emperor! Acknowledge me!” He walks a few more steps, and in a dramatic gesture, opens his coat, exposing his chest as a target. “If there is any soldier among you who wants to kill his emperor,” he continues, his voice firm, “here I am!” For a moment, there is silence. Then, somewhere in the royalist lines, a voice can be heard ordering men to open fire. But no one does. The line stands, fearful, indecisive. And then, a different cry is heard. “Vive l’Empereur!” “Long Live the Emperor!” (loc 109)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The “encounter at Laffrey” stands as one of the most dramatic moments in one of the most dramatic lives anyone has ever lived. It was also, to an extent that historians have not always recognized, stage-managed. One of Napoleon’s officers had met with a royalist officer before the confrontation, and the royalist had confessed that his men would probably refuse to fire on their former sovereign. Napoleon’s envoy then suggested, with a crowd of royalist soldiers listening in, that Napoleon could make a personal appeal. While the emperor could not know for sure that the royalists would hold their fire, when he opened his coat on the afternoon of March 7, he did so with reasonable confidence that his gesture would have the intended effect. (loc 127)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>From his first campaigns in the mid-1790s, he knew the political importance of actively crafting his image in all available media: print, painting, sculpture, oratory, even architecture. […]</p>
<p>He was a product of the first great modern age of celebrity, and he understood, viscerally, how to manage celebrity in the service of power. (loc 137)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it is all too easy to see him as a pure force—and freak—of nature who imposed himself on the world through sheer boldness and brilliance. Bold and brilliant he was, but also shrewd. He understood how radically Europe had changed in the decades during which he had come of age, and he knew better than anyone else how to seize the new opportunities that had arisen. (loc 140)</p>

<p>the churches taught submission: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s” (Matthew 22); “For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power … shall receive to themselves damnation” (Romans 13). (loc 170)</p>

<p>The events of this first stage of the French Revolution damaged the country in some ways. But they also swept aside social privilege and inefficient state institutions and engendered new ideas and practices of national sovereignty and civic equality. With the coming of elections and a raucous free press, political figures learned to appeal directly to ordinary citizens to gain power. (loc 226)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it also radically changed the nature of war. At the time of Napoleon’s birth, European warfare had, by the horrific standards of previous centuries, turned remarkably limited. While kings and princes fought each other for territory and commercial advantage, they did not generally seek to overthrow each other’s regimes. (loc 233)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The French strategist Count Guibert predicted that if a free and virtuous nation were to arise in the midst of Europe, “its style of war will not be the one practiced by states today. … Terrible in its wrath, it will bring fire and steel to its enemy’s hearth.” (loc 249)</p>

<p>revolutionary generals now sought out major battles to make best use of their superior numbers, encouraged the formation of new revolutionary governments in occupied territories, and ransacked those territories to keep their own forces supplied. (loc 280)</p>

<p>the Revolution made him possible, by making possible the new forms of political authority and the new forms of war. […]</p>
<p>Napoleon built on the military successes enabled by the new forms of warfare so as to craft his political persona as a hero and savior; to inspire (at least for a time) very genuine popular support and thereby to hold power. (loc 294)</p>

<p>Like countless lonely children, before and after, Napoleon found comfort and companionship in books. We do not know what he read at this earliest stage, but by adolescence the habit of intensive reading had already become deeply engrained. “I lived like a bear … always alone in my small room with my books … my only friends!” (loc 335)</p>

<p>He had a stroke of luck when the commander of the artillery was wounded and Christophe Salicetti, a Corsican member of the National Convention and patron of the Buonapartes, named him to the vacant position. Napoleon showed political ruthlessness immediately, denouncing superior officers to the dictatorial Committee of Public Safety in order to get his own battle plans approved. He also demonstrated his tremendous energy and military acumen by effectively reorganizing the artillery, identifying a crucial weak point in Toulon’s defenses and leading the attack against it personally. He demonstrated genuine physical courage as well, receiving a bayonet wound to the thigh and having a horse shot out from under him. Toulon fell to the Republic, and another powerful deputy wrote to Paris praising Napoleon as an officer of “transcendent merit.” Still just twenty-four years old, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.

<p>with Rose, things were much more serious, and after six months he prevailed on the older woman to marry him, much to the displeasure of his own family. She thereafter went by the name he bestowed on her: Joséphine. Her ardor never matched his, and she took lovers when he left on campaign, causing him considerable anguish. (loc 456)</p>

<p>At the start of this period, just twenty-six years old, he was already an important French general, but still just one of several. Three and a half years later, he was, without exaggeration, the new Caesar. (loc 481)</p>

<p>The genuinely extraordinary mental abilities that he had now had the chance to display to the fullest.

<p>Napoleon understood, far better than his rivals, and far better than his predecessors on the merry-go-round of French revolutionary politics, that in a newly democratic age, political success depended on forging a bond with ordinary people. (loc 507)</p>

<p>he did not hesitate to give his men a share of the spoils. Much later, in exile, he remembered telling them: “I will lead you into the most fertile plains on earth. Rich provinces, wealthy towns, all will be yours for the taking. There you will find honor, and glory, and riches.” The soldiers in fact shared in the vast sums that France extracted from Italy during the campaign: (loc 554)</p>

<p>At various points in the eighteenth century, France had cast a covetous glance toward Egypt as a possible site of colonization. Ruled by the warrior caste of the Mamelukes under the nominal aegis of the Turks’ Ottoman Empire, the country possessed a strategic position on both the Mediterranean and Red Seas. (In theory, it could even serve as a base for attacking Britain’s colonies in India.) For Napoleon, the idea of conquering it served a triple purpose. It gave him the perfect excuse to withdraw from a political scene that was not yet ready for him. It offered him the chance to add even more laurels to his reputation—and what better destination, for a man so frequently compared to Alexander the Great and Caesar, than a country both had conquered in their days?

<p>After brutally repressing it, with a death toll in the thousands, Napoleon displayed the same ruthlessness as in Italy, coldly ordering his men to behead three hundred more rebels and throw their corpses into the Nile. Meanwhile, the invasion helped provoke the formation of a new, broad-based coalition against France, (loc 710)</p>

<p>In order to intimidate the population and impress the Turkish commanders, he gave his troops free rein to sack and pillage for days after Jaffa had surrendered. He also ordered three thousand captured enemy soldiers taken down to the beach and shot, claiming he did not have the manpower to hold them prisoner. This last decision spurred an anguished discussion among his generals, which Napoleon supposedly ended by screaming at his closest aide, Berthier, that if he felt squeamish, he could go off and become a monk.

<p>The French today do not much admire Napoleon Bonaparte, but to the extent they do, it is for his domestic achievements during the period 1799–1804, known as the Consulate. It was a period of authoritarian rule but also of energetic state-building, during which Napoleon established institutions and principles by which the French still govern themselves today.

<p>He mistrusted the very notion of political liberty, which in his view produced the kind of wild, dangerous political lurches that threatened the country’s very survival. He considered himself a man of the Revolution, but what he admired in the Revolution was its hostility to undeserved social privilege, to intolerance and superstition, and to sloth and inefficiency disguised as tradition.

<p>Further from the seat of power but still important were a group of revolutionary intellectuals called the “Ideologues”—they in fact invented the word, along with “ideology,” which they defined as the “science of ideas.” They believed that a proper understanding of how the mind worked would allow them to instill rational beliefs and cooperative behavior in the general population, thereby eliminating political strife, and perhaps even the need for political competition.

<p>Rather than wait for subordinate generals to turn the situation around, Napoleon took a colossal gamble. In the spring, he put together an army of thirty-five thousand men from reserve forces in France and led them in person over one of the highest and most treacherous passes in the Alps, coming out into the north Italian plain, cutting off the Austrian army from its base and supplies. (loc 820)</p>

<p>Soon after the coup of the Eighteenth Brumaire, he shouldered aside Emmanuel Sieyès, and the new constitution stipulated that only one Consul, chosen for a term of ten years, would exercise real power. This constitution did provide for a parliament but restricted its powers by splitting it into the Tribunate, which had the right to discuss legislation but not vote, and the Legislative Assembly, which could vote but not discuss. (loc 873)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Over mild and hesitant opposition from his tame Senate, he insisted on yet another new constitution (the fifth in eleven years), which transformed him into Consul for Life and gave him the ability to choose his successor, while leaving most other aspects of the government as they were. Another plebiscite took place and delivered a large majority in favor, which the Interior Ministry again rigged to look even more impressive. It was a clear move toward monarchy, and in keeping with the shift, Napoleon’s face began to appear on French coins. Yet Napoleon continued to identify himself with the French Revolution, and the right continued to plot against him. (loc 883)</p>

<p>Napoleon’s France had no gulag and no concentration camps. Throughout Napoleon’s fifteen years in power, there were few political executions, and the rate of political imprisonment remained tiny by modern standards. (loc 902)</p>

<p>keeping Portugal under control required the cooperation of the large country lying between it and France, namely Spain. In theory, Spain had been France’s ally since 1796, (loc 1288)</p>

<p>the attempt to place a Bonaparte on the Spanish throne triggered not just insurrections but a massive rebellion. In Madrid itself, Murat’s men fought bloody street battles in the first days of May, and massacred hundreds of prisoners before restoring order. (The painter Francisco Goya immortalized the scenes in his brilliant works Dos de Mayo and Tres de Mayo.) (loc 1306)</p>

<p>The French could eventually capture most Spanish cities and towns, but the countryside was far more difficult to subdue. As in the Kingdom of Naples, guerrilla bands took shape—in fact, the modern word “guerrilla,” Spanish for “little war,” dates from precisely these events. (loc 1326)</p>

<p>Napoleon’s Russian campaign is best remembered for the frigid retreat, but the scorching summer advance proved almost as damaging to the Grande Armée. (loc 1432)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>of the original 655,000-strong force, scarcely 85,000 men made it back out of Russia. Some 370,000 had died; 200,000 more were prisoners or missing. Napoleon himself left the army in early December and headed back to Paris. (loc 1467)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In the popular imagination, Napoleon’s downfall proceeded directly from this catastrophe. Historians caution, however, that the emperor still controlled vast territories and could draw on unmatched human resources (loc 1471)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The campaigns of 1813, which Napoleon fought in Germany against the so-called Sixth Coalition, included several close-run battles that came close to reversing his fortunes. Napoleon showed no compunction in continuing the struggle and in sacrificing hundreds of thousands more (loc 1473)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the losses in Russia of horses, materiel, and experienced men told against him at several decisive moments. He also made his share of strategic mistakes, notably dividing his forces before the mammoth Battle of Leipzig in October and leaving a crucial detachment behind in the Saxon capital of Dresden. Leipzig, also known as the “Battle of the Nations,” was the largest battle ever fought in European history up to that time, (loc 1557)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Over the next weeks, support for the Bourbons grew. Talleyrand felt the exiled family offered France the best chance of receiving a fair deal from the British, who would have a harder time taking advantage of a king they had long recognized, if only in name, as the country’s legitimate sovereign. (Talleyrand also thought, needless to say, that Louis best served Talleyrand.) (loc 1600)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Less than a year after leaving France, Napoleon would return in secret, rally his supporters, and seize power for a second time. He would restore the Empire, resuscitate the Grande Armée, and march across the frontier to confront his enemies. Only after his defeat at Waterloo in June 1815 by Wellington would his fall from power become permanent. (loc 1626)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Had Louis submitted his new constitution to a plebiscite, as Napoleon had done, he might well have established his rule on a firm basis. But on this very point—popular sovereignty—he refused to make concessions. He was the chosen of God, and rather than accepting the constitution from the people, he insisted on “granting” it to them, while banishing the tricolor flag for which so many of them had died. (loc 1644)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The allies, however, had different ideas. Their representatives had been meeting since September in an unprecedented gathering, the Congress of Vienna, to plan the future of the continent. It would eventually produce one of the longest lasting and effective peace settlements in European history, based on a system whereby the great powers would cooperate to manage crises and avoid full-scale war. (loc 1670)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Waterloo itself immediately achieved legendary status as one of the greatest battles in history, but in truth it is hard to believe that a French victory there could have actually changed history. The forces deployed against France were simply too great, and the allies too determined. (loc 1685)</p>

<p>Napoleon spent these years seeking control not over Europe but over how history would remember him. It was the last chapter of his life but, more important, the first chapter of the longer, hugely contentious story of his historical significance. (loc 1716)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The “Concert of Europe” designed at Vienna by the allies, still reeling from two decades of intense Napoleonic conflict, succeeded in keeping a closely managed peace for longer than any previous European settlement and most subsequent ones as well (far better than Versailles, a century later). (loc 1727)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Bonapartism as a political model continued to have resonance worldwide. In December 1804, one onlooker at Napoleon’s coronation had been an impressionable twenty-one year-old Venezuelan named Simon Bolívar. “The universal acclaim and the interest which his person inspired,” Bolívar later remembered, “made me think of the slavery of my country, and the glory that would benefit the one who liberated it.” (loc 1733)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>French and German strategists of the late nineteenth century took inspiration from Napoleon in developing new tactical doctrines centered on massive, sacrificial infantry offensives—doctrines that led directly to the slaughterhouse of the World War I trenches. (loc 1747)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The greatest of French Romantic authors, Victor Hugo, the son of a Napoleonic general, wrestled with Napoleon’s ghost all his life, lamenting the political tyranny and the human suffering but always hailing the “sublime spectacle.” (loc 1781)</p>
<p><em>What an artist dies in him</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>His continuing popularity helps explain how one of the least competent political adventurers in European history nonetheless managed to become one of France’s longest lasting rulers in the mid-nineteenth century. Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the son of Napoleon’s younger brother Louis, had his uncle’s ambition but little of his charisma and none of his genius. (loc 1795)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>in 1848 yet another French Revolution toppled King Louis-Philippe and replaced his reign with the unstable Second Republic. Amid fears of civil war, Louis-Napoleon won election as president and after three years of frustrating political conflict seized dictatorial power by force. In 1852 he proclaimed himself Emperor Napoleon III. (loc 1799)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it is hard not to endorse these criticisms of Napoleon. The man who boasted to Metternich of his indifference to millions of lives is hard indeed to admire. The reestablishment of slavery, the endless slaughter of the battlefields, the authoritarian rule, the imperial ventures, all make for a damning and lengthy indictment. (loc 1869)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>History, in the end, is not a judicial procedure. It is a quest for understanding. And it is also a quest to expose the full, amazingly broad and varied canvas of human activity. And from this point of view, as Victor Hugo recognized very well, the “sublime spectacle” matters. Napoleon may have been, from many points of view, a criminal, but he was not a criminal on the scale of the twentieth-century dictators, who made mass murder and terror the basis of their social and political systems. For all his crimes and errors, his life also incarnated a sense of sheer human possibility that quite rightly fascinated onlookers at the time and has continued to do so ever since. We look at his life and recoil from parts of it in horror. But at the same time, inescapably, there is something that takes the breath away. As Shakespeare’s Cassius said of Caesar, “Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world / Like a Colossus.” What a novel his life was. (loc 1876)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CIA guide on knowing thyself]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A phenomenal resource on rationality and decision-making – perhaps the best in its genre. The title undersells the book. Despite coming out of the CIA, the book contains lessons that apply far beyond intelligence analysis; I think it is a necessary read for anyone who wants to do <em>intelligent</em> analysis. Furthermore, it is not just about psychology – it is about the philosophy, sociology, and practicality of intelligent analysis.</p>
<p>The core premise of the book is that people make analytical judgments by processing sensory information through their cognitive machinery, without understanding the weaknesses of either the sensory processes or their cognitive machinery. Heuer seeks to ameliorate this by giving a concise overview of our perception and memory systems, with an emphasis on their pitfalls in the context of analytical work. After all, we presumably did not evolve on the savannah to piece together the motives of foreign nation-states.</p>
<p>Building from there, Heuer gives a guided tour of the required competencies of an analyst (e.g., creativity and open-mindedness), why we are generally deficient in these areas, and practical tools for improvement. This involves some epistemological detours, of a similar flavour to Sowell’s <em>Knowledge and Decisions</em> (which, I should say, I still haven’t finished!). I particularly enjoyed the exploration of how exactly analytical judgments can be generated, for example, using historical analogy is philosophically different to drawing on theory, but both can be valid depending on the situation.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the book is the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) framework, a simple (but not simplistic) tool for deciding between various hypotheses, which has been deliberately designed to offset various cognitive biases. Speaking of cognitive biases, the survey herein is par excellence – they are grouped by category (perceiving evidence, judging cause and effect, estimating probabilities) and Heuer finds the perfect balance of psychological background and practical exposition. As one would expect from a handbook aimed at time-constrained decision-makers, the book is exceedingly well structured and crystal clear (making <a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> feel clumsy by comparison)</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that <em>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</em> is highly recommended in trading/investing circles – I can’t find a concept in the book that isn’t relevant to the role, and its influence is clear in other great resources like <a href="/?books=geopolitical-alpha" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Geopolitical Alpha</a> (whose Constraints Framework is a modified version of ACH). Really, all one would need on top of this is a similar book about the philosophy and practicality of statistical modelling (a combination of <a href="/?books=modelling-mindsets" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Modelling Mindsets</a> and <a href="/?books=regression-modelling-strategies" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Regression Modelling Strategies</a> in conjunction could get you most of the way there, but I’m still on the lookout for the definitive text).</p>
<p>I guess after reading all these books on decision-making and rational thinking, I’ve realised it does just boil down to what the Greeks had chiselled into the temple at Delphi – ”Know Thyself”. Richard Heuer’s book is a decisive step towards that goal!</p>

<p>Many functions associated with perception, memory, and information processing are conducted prior to and independently of any conscious direction. What appears spontaneously in consciousness is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking. (loc 6540)</p>

<p>Weaknesses and biases inherent in human thinking processes can be demonstrated through carefully designed experiments. They can be alleviated by conscious application of tools and techniques that should be in the analytical tradecraft toolkit of all intelligence analysts. (loc 6542)</p>

<p>Dick Heuer&#39;s writings make three fundamental points about the cognitive challenges intelligence analysts face:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The mind is poorly &quot;wired&quot; to deal effectively with both inherent uncertainty (the natural fog surrounding complex, indeterminate intelligence issues) and induced uncertainty (the man-made fog fabricated by denial and deception operations).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Even increased awareness of cognitive and other &quot;unmotivated&quot; biases, such as the tendency to see information confirming an already-held judgment more vividly than one sees &quot;disconfirming&quot; information, does little by itself to help analysts deal effectively with uncertainty.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Tools and techniques that gear the analyst&#39;s mind to apply higher levels of critical thinking can substantially improve analysis on complex issues on which information is incomplete, ambiguous, and often deliberately distorted. Key examples of such intellectual devices include techniques for structuring information, challenging assumptions, and exploring alternative interpretations. (loc 206)</li>

<p>A central focus of this book is to illuminate the role of the observer in determining what is observed and how it is interpreted. People construct their own version of &quot;reality&quot; on the basis of information provided by the senses, but this sensory input is mediated by complex mental processes that determine which information is attended to, how it is organized, and the meaning attributed to it.

<p>New information is assimilated to existing images. This principle explains why gradual, evolutionary change often goes unnoticed.

<p>Initial exposure to blurred or ambiguous stimuli interferes with accurate perception even after more and better information becomes available. This effect has been demonstrated experimentally by projecting onto a screen pictures of common, everyday subjects such as a dog standing on grass, a fire hydrant, and an aerial view of a highway cloverleaf intersection. The initial projection was blurred in varying degrees, and the pictures were then brought into focus slowly to determine at what point test subjects could identify them correctly. This experiment showed two things. First, those who started viewing the pictures when they were most out of focus had more difficulty identifying them when they became clearer than those who started viewing at a less blurred stage. In other words, the greater the initial blur, the clearer the picture had to be before people could recognize it. (loc 504)</p>

<p>When the position of chess pieces on the board corresponds to a recognized schema, it is very easy for the master to remember not only the positions of the pieces, but the outcomes of previous games in which the pieces were in these positions.

<p>When dealing with a new and unfamiliar subject, the uncritical and relatively non-selective accumulation and review of information is an appropriate first step. But this is a process of absorbing information, not analyzing it. Analysis begins when the analyst consciously inserts himself or herself into the process to select, sort, and organize information. This selection and organization can only be accomplished according to conscious or subconscious assumptions and preconceptions. (loc 993)</p>

<p>The mathematical model based on the analyst&#39;s actual decisions is invariably a more accurate description of that analyst&#39;s decision-making than the analyst&#39;s own verbal description of how the judgments were made. (loc 1255)</p>

<p>According to the mosaic theory of intelligence, small pieces of information are collected that, when put together like a mosaic or jigsaw puzzle, eventually enable analysts to perceive a clear picture of reality. The analogy suggests that accurate estimates depend primarily upon having all the pieces, that is, upon accurate and relatively complete information. […]</p>
<p>Insights from cognitive psychology suggest that intelligence analysts do not work this way and that the most difficult analytical tasks cannot be approached in this manner. […]</p>
<p>A more accurate analogy for describing how intelligence analysis should work is medical diagnosis.

<p>Strategic Assumptions vs. Tactical Indicators. Abraham Ben-Zvi analyzed five cases of intelligence failure to foresee a surprise attack.

<p>whenever strategic assumptions and tactical indicators of impending attack converged, an immediate threat was perceived and appropriate precautionary measures were taken.

<p>Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, sometimes abbreviated ACH, is a tool to aid judgment on important issues requiring careful weighing of alternative explanations or conclusions. It helps an analyst overcome, or at least minimize, some of the cognitive limitations that make prescient intelligence analysis so difficult (loc 1840)</p>

<p>Analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH) requires an analyst to explicitly identify all the reasonable alternatives and have them compete against each other for the analyst&#39;s favor, rather than evaluating their plausibility one at a time. (loc 1850)</p>
<p><em>Solves the problem of recency bias!</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For each hypothesis, ask yourself this question: If this hypothesis is true, what should I expect to be seeing or not seeing? What are all the things that must have happened, or may still be happening, and that one should expect to see evidence of? If you are not seeing this evidence, why not? (loc 1907)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Then analyze how each piece of evidence relates to each hypothesis. This differs from the normal procedure, which is to look at one hypothesis at a time in order to consider how well the evidence supports that hypothesis. That will be done later, in Step 5. (loc 1921)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In some cases it may be useful to refine this procedure by using a numerical probability, rather than a general notation such as plus or minus, to describe how the evidence relates to each hypothesis. To do this, ask the following question for each cell in the matrix: If this hypothesis is true, what is the probability that I would be seeing this item of evidence? (loc 1953)</p>

<p>People formulate alternative explanations or estimates and select the one that encompasses the greatest amount of evidence within a logically consistent scenario.

<p>Because of a need to impose order on our environment, we seek and often believe we find causes for what are actually accidental or random phenomena. People overestimate the extent to which other countries are pursuing a coherent, coordinated, rational plan, and thus also overestimate their own ability to predict future events in those nations. People also tend to assume that causes are similar to their effects, in the sense that important or large effects must have large causes. When inferring the causes of behavior, too much weight is accorded to personal qualities and dispositions of the actor and not enough to situational determinants of the actor&#39;s behavior. People also overestimate their own importance as both a cause and a target of the behavior of others. Finally, people often perceive relationships that do not in fact exist, because they do not have an intuitive understanding of the kinds and amount of information needed to prove a relationship.

<p>analysts tend to assume that economic events have primarily economic causes, that big events have important consequences, and that little events cannot affect the course of history.

<p>Intelligence analysts are familiar with the problem of weighing internal versus external causes of behavior in a number of contexts. When a new leader assumes control of a foreign government, analysts assess the likely impact of changed leadership on government policy. For example, will the former Defense Minister who becomes Prime Minister continue to push for increases in the defense budget? Analysts weigh the known predispositions of the new Prime Minister, based on performance in previous positions, against the requirements of the situation that constrain the available options. If relatively complete information is available on the situational constraints, analysts may make an accurate judgment on such questions. Lacking such information, they tend to err on the side of assuming that the individual&#39;s personal predispositions will prompt continuation of past behavior. (loc 2490)</p>
<p><em>This is one of the key ideas in</em> <em><a href="/?books=geopolitical-alpha" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Geopolitical Alpha</a></em> <em>– pay attention to the constraints of the situation vs individual desires.</em></p>

<p>The act of constructing a detailed scenario for a possible future event makes that event more readily imaginable and, therefore, increases its perceived probability. This is the experience of CIA analysts who have used various tradecraft tools that require, or are especially suited to, the analysis of unlikely but nonetheless possible and important hypotheses. (loc 2762)</p>
<p><em>Been there… when you’ve put a lot of effort into understanding a tail event, one can overestimate the odds of the event.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One technique for avoiding the anchoring bias, to weigh anchor so to speak, may be to ignore one&#39;s own or others&#39; earlier judgments and rethink a problem from scratch. In other words, consciously avoid any prior judgment as a starting point. There is no experimental evidence to show that this is possible or that it will work, but it seems worth trying. Alternatively, it is sometimes possible to avoid human error by employing formal statistical procedures. (loc 2803)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hindsight biases influence the evaluation of intelligence reporting in three ways: Analysts normally overestimate the accuracy of their past judgments. Intelligence consumers normally underestimate how much they learned from intelligence reports. Overseers of intelligence production who conduct postmortem analyses of an intelligence failure normally judge that events were more readily foreseeable than was in fact the case. (loc 2970)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the receipt of what is accepted as definitive or authoritative information causes an immediate but unconscious restructuring of a person&#39;s mental images to make them consistent with the new information. Once past perceptions have been restructured, it seems very difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct accurately what one&#39;s thought processes were or would have been before this restructuring.

<p>Analysts should ask themselves, &quot;If the opposite outcome had occurred, would I have been surprised?&quot; Consumers should ask, &quot;If this report had told me the opposite, would I have believed it?&quot; And overseers should ask, &quot;If the opposite outcome had occurred, would it have been predictable given the information that was available?&quot; (loc 3129)</p>

They are not terribly sophisticated, but I mean that as a point of intrigue rather than a criticism – it demonstrates that there are indeed simple sources of edge out there, though as the author’s lived experience shows, turning them into a sustainable source of trading profits is a different matter. Overall this is a decent book for day traders, but for institutional traders it will fall flat.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HAPPINESS, FREE, FOR EVERYONE, AND LET NO ONE BE FORGOTTEN]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Roadside Picnic</em> is a deserving entry on any list of sci-fi classics, certainly due to its standalone merit, but also because of the unique history of the novel. It was written during the depths of the Cold War, at a time when art was strictly monitored and censored by the Soviet state, and was one of the few works of science fiction to cross the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>The novel is set post-“visitation” – aliens came and left without interacting with humans, leaving behind Zones that contain strange, seemingly magical objects. The lack of visible aliens as a narrative device creates a vacuum that the human mind must attempt to fill (both for the characters in the novel and the reader). This theme was also deployed in Clarke’s <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em> , which was coincidentally written just two years after <em>Roadside</em>, but** instead of the cosmic majesty on which Clarke waxes lyrical, the Strugatskys embed the Zones in a bleak, practical world wherein the characters are normal people, primarily concerned with looking after their families and putting food on the table, as opposed to the “great men” of several other sci-fi novels (like a Hari Seldon in *Foundation* or Paul Atreides in <a href="/?books=dune" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Dune</a>).</p>
<p>The setting emphasises the grit of quotidian life rather than wondrous sci-fi technology (<em>Neuromancer</em> is another book that does this well). There is no tone of excitement surrounding the alien technology in the zones, instead, the mood is one of unfulfilled nervousness – people don’t understand anything about how the technology works, and thus don’t feel like they are using the devices correctly. This all leads to an existential exploration of <em>why</em> we were visited in the first place, which is the philosophical core of the novel (and the source of the title).</p>
<p>It’s tempting to try and fit a Soviet analogy onto <em>Roadside</em> , given its historical context, but I’m not certain this is easy nor advisable. Because of the political environment, in which some subversive artists were literally sent to gulags (Julian Barnes’ <a href="/?books=the-noise-of-time" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Noise of Time</a> explores the angst this caused for Shostakovich), the Strugatskys would have had to bury their metaphors deeply. It also feels somewhat patronising to the authors to see the novel as allegorical… perhaps they would prefer it to be appreciated as a piece of historical fiction in its own right, rather than needing political subtext to lend it weight. But how can one ignore the desperate plea of the protagonist in the wrenching conclusion of the book: “I have no words, they haven’t taught me the words; I don’t know how to think, those bastards didn’t let me learn how to think. But if you really are—all powerful, all knowing, all understanding—figure it out! Look into my soul, I know—everything you need is in there. It has to be. Because I’ve never sold my soul to anyone! It’s mine, it’s human!”.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium">Foreword from Ursula Le Guin</summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Part of this foreword is taken from a review of Roadside Picnic I wrote in 1977, the year the book first came out in English.* I wanted to keep some record of a reader’s response at a time when the worst days of Soviet censorship were fresh in memory, and intellectually and morally interesting novels from Russia still had the glamour of risk-taking courage about them. A time, also, when a positive review of a work of Soviet science fiction was a small but real political statement in the United States, since part of the American science fiction community had undertaken to fight the Cold War by assuming every writer who lived behind the Iron Curtain was an enemy ideologue. (loc 22)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This use of ordinary people as the principal characters was fairly rare in science fiction when the book came out, and even now the genre slips easily into elitism—superbrilliant minds, extraordinary talents, officers not crew, the corridors of power not the working-class kitchen. (loc 53)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Those who want the genre to remain specialized—”hard”—tend to prefer the elitist style. Those who see science fiction simply as a way of writing novels welcome the more Tolstoyan approach, in which a war is described not only from the generals’ point of view but also through the eyes of housewives, prisoners, and boys of sixteen, (loc 55)</p>

<p>“You are absolutely right. Our little town is a hole. Always was and always will be. Except right now,” I say, “it’s a hole into the future. And the stuff we fish out of this hole will change your whole stinking world. Life will be different, the way it should be, and no one will want for anything. That’s our hole for you. There’s knowledge pouring through this hole. And when we figure it out, we’ll make everyone rich, and we’ll fly to the stars, and we’ll go wherever we want. That’s the kind of hole we have here (loc 672)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And you know the amazing thing: I’m telling him this, and I completely believe in what I’m saying. And our Zone, the evil bitch, the murderess, is at that moment a hundred times dearer to me than all their Europes and Africas. (loc 686)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>What do you actually think about the Visit? Even if not seriously.” “Fine, I’ll tell you. But I have to warn you, Richard, that your question falls under the umbrella of a pseudoscience called xenology. Xenology is an unnatural mixture of science fiction and formal logic. At its core is a flawed assumption—that an alien race would be psychologically human.” “Why flawed?” asked Noonan. “Because biologists have already been burned attempting to apply human psychology to animals. Earth animals, I note.” “Just a second,” said Noonan. “That’s totally different. We’re talking about the psychology of intelligent beings.” “True. And that would be just fine, if we knew what intelligence was.” “And we don’t?” asked Noonan in surprise. “Believe it or not, we don’t. We usually proceed from a trivial definition: intelligence is the attribute of man that separates his activity from that of the animals. It’s a kind of attempt to distinguish the master from his dog, who seems to understand everything but can’t speak. However, this trivial definition does lead to wittier ones. They are based on depressing observations of the aforementioned human activity. For example: intelligence is the ability of a living creature to perform pointless or unnatural acts.” (loc 1875)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“A picnic. Imagine: a forest, a country road, a meadow. A car pulls off the road into the meadow and unloads young men, bottles, picnic baskets, girls, transistor radios, cameras … A fire is lit, tents are pitched, music is played. And in the morning they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that were watching the whole night in horror crawl out of their shelters. And what do they see? An oil spill, a gasoline puddle, old spark plugs and oil filters strewn about … Scattered rags, burntout bulbs, someone has dropped a monkey wrench. The wheels have tracked mud from some godforsaken swamp … and, of course, there are the remains of the campfire, apple cores, candy wrappers, tins, bottles, someone’s handkerchief, someone’s penknife, old ragged newspapers, coins, wilted flowers from another meadow …” “I get it,” said Noonan. “A roadside picnic.” (loc 1908)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘You ask: what makes man great?’” he quoted. “‘Is it that he re-created nature? That he harnessed forces of almost-cosmic proportions? That in a brief time he has conquered the planet and opened a window onto the universe? No! It is that despite all this, he has survived, and intends to continue doing so.’” (loc 1921)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>at first he didn’t hear what this talking key was shouting, but then something seemed to switch on inside him, and he heard: “Happiness for everyone! Free! As much happiness as you want! Everyone gather round! Plenty for everyone! No one will be forgotten! Free! Happiness! Free!” With that he abruptly went quiet, as if a huge hand had forcefully shoved a gag into his mouth. And Redrick saw the transparent emptiness lurking in the shadow of the excavator bucket grab him, jerk him up into the air, and slowly, with an effort, twist him, the way a housewife wrings out the laundry. (loc 2709)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>he was no longer trying to think. He just kept repeating to himself in despair, like a prayer, “I’m an animal, you can see that I’m an animal. I have no words, they haven’t taught me the words; I don’t know how to think, those bastards didn’t let me learn how to think. But if you really are—all powerful, all knowing, all understanding—figure it out! Look into my soul, I know—everything you need is in there. It has to be. Because I’ve never sold my soul to anyone! It’s mine, it’s human! Figure out yourself what I want—because I know it can’t be bad! The hell with it all, I just can’t think of a thing other than those words of his—HAPPINESS, FREE, FOR EVERYONE, AND LET NO ONE BE FORGOTTEN!” (loc 2749)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Essential trader lore]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first read the original <em>Market Wizards</em> in high school, when I knew so little about markets that the contents may as well have been gospel. I didn’t have the knowledge to contextualise the ideas of the interviewees, let alone criticise them. Now that I have some lived experience of my own, <em>Market Wizards</em> has been overdue for a re-read.</p>
<p>Over time, my perspective on the interviewee’s points of advice has evolved as follows: 1) treating them as revelatory truths 2) reasoning through them and therefore believing them to be true (in the language of Aquinas, evolving from revelatory truth to rational truth) 3) realising that the existence of objective truth in markets is dubious and therefore the wisdom in the book can be true or false depending on the circumstance. No doubt, several years down the road I will come back and realise that I am on yet another Dunning-Kruger peak. To elaborate briefly on the third point, the book was published in 1989, with most of the wizards having made their money in the great stagflation of the 1970s. That is the context that has shaped their advice, and logically, their advice must be weighted in accordance with your view on whether we are entering the same broad-based inflationary regime. For example, in a sticky inflation environment, commodities trend, which perhaps explains the resoundingly repeated point that you should cut your losses and let winners run. If the market is trending, of course you should!</p>
<p>It is often pointed out by the “Fooled by Randomness” crowd that many of Schwager’s interviewees later blew up, or became grifters – in essence, arguing that trading success is primarily ruled by randomness. But given the extreme Pareto distribution in the trading industry, the fact that Schwager managed to identify <em>any</em> traders who have still survived is a strong argument against pure randomness, and some of the interviewees (PTJ, Kovner, Rogers) are not just survivors, but legends who redefined the industry and are still making money 30 years later.</p>
<p><em>Market Wizards</em> is a must-read for traders. It holds wisdom forged in the heat of battle, and provides a variety of failures to be learnt from – many of the wizards blew up early on, and it was the pain of these blowups that inculcated the strict discipline that enabled later successes. Notwithstanding my previous comment on regimes, the trading advice in the book still seems mostly applicable – for example, if a market fails to rally on good news, that’s bearish (this has come up in every book in the <em>Market Wizards</em> series). Even if you disagree with all the advice, you should still read the book, for it contains the classic stories that contribute to the collective lore of traders.</p>

<p>This was in July 1972 and, at the time, we were under price controls. The futures market was supposedly also under price controls. This was Nixon’s price freeze? Yes. As I recall, the plywood price was theoretically frozen at $110 per 1,000 square feet. Plywood was one of the markets I analyzed for the firm. The price had edged up close to $110, and I put out a bearish newsletter saying even though supplies were tight, since prices couldn’t go beyond $110, there was nothing to lose by going short at $110. […]</p>
<p>shortages developed in plywood, but supposedly the futures market was also under this guideline. However, no one was sure; it was sort of a gray area. One day, while I was looking at the quote board, the price hit $110. Then it hit $110.10; then $110.20. […]</p>
<p>If they let it trade over $110 today, they might let it trade anywhere. So I bought one contract. Well, ultimately, plywood went to $200. (loc 600)</p>

<p>During the great soybean bull market, the one that went from $3.25 to nearly $12, I impulsively took my profits and got out of everything. I was trying to be fancy instead of staying with the trend. Ed Seykota never would get out of anything unless the trend changed. So Ed was in, while I was out, and I watched in agony as soybeans went limit-up for twelve consecutive days. I was real competitive, and every day I would come into the office knowing he was in and I was out. I dreaded going to work, because I knew soybeans would be bid limit again and I couldn’t get in.

<p>The best trades are the ones in which you have all three things going for you: fundamentals, technicals, and market tone. First, the fundamentals should suggest that there is an imbalance of supply and demand, which could result in a major move. Second, the chart must show that the market is moving in the direction that the fundamentals suggest. Third, when news comes out, the market should act in a way that reflects the right psychological tone. For example, a bull market should shrug off bearish news and respond vigorously to bullish news. (loc 719)</p>

<p>I believe that the era of trend following is over until and unless there is a particular imbalance in a market that overrides everything else. [The 1988 drought in the grain belt, which developed shortly after this interview, provides a perfect example of the type of exception Marcus is describing.] Another exception would be if we were to enter a major inflationary or deflationary environment.

<p>I remember one time, during late 1978, the dollar was getting battered, falling to new lows every day. This was during a period when I was cooperating and trading as a colleague with Bruce Kovner. We used to talk hours every day. One day, we noticed that the dollar got mysteriously strong. There was an intense price movement that couldn’t be explained by any known information. We just bailed out of our long currency positions like crazy. That weekend, President Carter announced a dollar support program. If we had waited until the next U.S. trading session, we would have been annihilated. That situation illustrates one of the principles we believed in—namely, that the big players, including the governments, would always tip their hand. If we saw a surprise price move against us that we didn’t understand, we often got out and looked for the reason later. (loc 792)</p>

<p>**Is the implied rule that if you find a common behavior between markets, you want to sell the one that is lagging as soon as it starts heading down? ** You absolutely want to put down a bet when a market acts terribly relative to everything else.

<p>my decision to lift the short side of my spread position in the middle of a panic showed a complete disregard for risk. I think what bothered me so much was the realization that I had lost a process of rationality that I thought I had.

<p>October 19, 1987—the week of the stock market crash. I closed out all my positions on October 19 and 20 because I felt there was something happening in the world that I didn’t understand.

<p>**Is the generalization of that example that when an important fundamental development occurs, the initial direction of the market move is often a good tip-off of the longer-term trend? **</p>
<p>Exactly. The market usually leads because there are people who know more than you do. (loc 1305)</p>

<p>Technical analysis reflects the vote of the entire marketplace and, therefore, does pick up unusual behavior. By definition, anything that creates a new chart pattern is something unusual. It is very important for me to study the details of price action to see if I can observe something about how everybody is voting. Studying the charts is absolutely crucial and alerts me to existing disequilibria and potential changes. (loc 1332)</p>

<p>Tight congestions in which a breakout occurs for reasons that nobody understands are usually good risk/reward trades.</p>
<p>**How about breakouts that occur because there is a story in the Wall Street Journal that day? **</p>
<p>That would be much less relevant. The Heisenberg principle in physics provides an analogy for the markets. If something is closely observed, the odds are it is going to be altered in the process. If corn is in a tight consolidation and then breaks out the day the Wall Street Journal carries a story about a potential shortage of corn, the odds of the price move being sustained are much smaller. If everybody believes there is no reason for corn to break out, and it suddenly does, the chances that there is an important underlying cause are much greater. (loc 1343)</p>

<p>Whenever I enter a position, I have a predetermined stop. That is the only way I can sleep. I know where I’m getting out before I get in. The position size on a trade is determined by the stop, and the stop is determined on a technical basis. For example, if the market is in the midst of a trading range, it makes no sense to put your stop within that range, since you are likely to be taken out. I always place my stop beyond some technical barrier. (loc 1363)</p>

<p>the principal characteristic of a bear market is very sharp down movements followed by quick retracements.

<p><strong>Can you talk about your fundamental analysis methodology? How do you determine what the right price for a market should be?</strong></p>
<p>I assume that the price for a market on any given day is the correct price, then I try to figure out what changes are occurring that will alter that price. One of the jobs of a good trader is to imagine alternative scenarios. I try to form many different mental pictures of what the world should be like and wait for one of them to be confirmed. You keep trying them on one at a time. Inevitably, most of these pictures will turn out to be wrong—that is, only a few elements of the picture may prove correct. But then, all of a sudden, you will find that in one picture, nine out of ten elements click. That scenario then becomes your image of the world reality. (loc 1501)</p>

<p>For me, market analysis is like a tremendous multidimensional chess board. The pleasure of it is purely intellectual. For example, it is trying to figure out the problems the finance minister of New Zealand faces and how he may try to solve them. A lot of people will think that sounds ridiculously exotic. But to me, it isn’t exotic at all. Here is a guy running this tiny country and he has a real set of problems. He has to figure how to cope with Australia, the U.S., and the labor unions that are driving him crazy. My job is to do the puzzle with him and figure out what he is going to decide, and what the consequences of his actions will be that he or the market doesn’t anticipate. That to me, in itself, is tremendous fun. (loc 1553)</p>

<p>First, I would say that risk management is the most important thing to be well understood. Undertrade, undertrade, undertrade is my second piece of advice.

<p>Jones has succeeded in every major venture he has tried. He started out in the business as a broker and in his second year grossed over $1 million in commissions. In fall 1980, Jones went to the New York Cotton Exchange as an independent floor trader. Again he was spectacularly successful, making millions during the next few years. (loc 2222)</p>

<p>Jones speaks with admiration about his first tutor in the business, the legendary cotton trader, Eli Tullis. Perhaps the one trait of Tullis that made the greatest impression on Jones was his steel-hard emotional control. He recalls how Tullis could carry on a polite, relaxed conversation with visitors, without blinking an eye, at the same time his positions were getting decimated in the market. (loc 2250)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Tullis taught me about moving volume. When you are trading size, you have to get out when the market lets you out, not when you want to get out. He taught me that if you want to move a large position, you don’t wait until the market is in new high or low ground because very little volume may trade there if it is a turning point. (loc 2312)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>if, for example, the old high was at 56.80, there are probably going to be a lot of buy stops at 56.85. If the market is trading at 70 bid, 75 offered, the whole trading ring has a vested interest in buying the market, touching off those stops, and liquidating into the stops—that is a very common ring practice. As an upstairs trader, I put that together with what Eli taught me. If I want to cover a position in that type of situation, I will liquidate half at 75, so that I won’t have to worry about getting out of the entire position at the point where the stops are being hit. I will always liquidate half my position below new highs or lows and the remaining half beyond that point.</p>
<p>**Any other lessons you can attribute to Tullis? **</p>
<p>By watching Eli, I learned that even though markets look their very best when they are setting new highs, that is often the best time to sell. He instilled in me the idea that, to some extent, to be a good trader, you have to be a contrarian.</p>
<p><strong>You have done tens of thousands of trades. Is there any single trade that stands out?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the 1979 cotton market. One learns the most from mistakes, not successes. I was a broker back then. We had lots of speculative accounts and I was long about 400 contracts of July cotton. The market had been trading in a range between 82 and 86 cents, and I was buying it every time it came down to the low end of that range. One day, the market broke to new lows, took out the stops, and immediately rebounded about 30 or 40 points. I thought the reason the market had been acting so poorly was because of the price vulnerability implied by the proximity of those well-known stops. Now that the stops had been touched off, I thought the market was ready to rally. I was standing outside the ring at the time. In an act of bravado, I told my floor broker to bid 82.90 for 100 July, which at the time was a very big order. He bid 90 for 100, and I remember the Refco broker came running across the pit screaming, “Sold!” Refco owned most of the certificated stock at that time [the type of cotton available for delivery against the contract]. In an instant I realized that they intended to deliver against the July contract, which then was trading at about a 4-cent premium to the October contract. It also dawned on me that the whole congestion pattern that had formed between 82 and 86 cents was going to be a market measurement for the next move down [the break from 82 cents was going to equal the width of the prior 4-cent trading range]. (loc 2315)</p>

<p>The most important rule of trading is to play great defense, not great offense. Every day I assume every position I have is wrong. I know where my stop risk points are going to be. I do that so I can define my maximum possible drawdown. Hopefully, I spend the rest of the day enjoying positions that are going in my direction. If they are going against me, then I have a game plan for getting out. Don’t be a hero. Don’t have an ego. Always question yourself and your ability. Don’t ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead. (loc 2401)</p>

<p>we have found one that actually works well. It is a very good system, but for obvious reasons, I can’t tell you much more about it.</p>
<p><strong>What type of realm does it fall into: contrarian? trend following?</strong></p>
<p>Trend following. The basic premise of the system is that markets move sharply when they move. If there is a sudden range expansion in a market that has been trading narrowly, human nature is to try to fade that price move. When you get a range expansion, the market is sending you a very loud, clear signal that the market is getting ready to move in the direction of that expansion. (loc 2530)</p>

<p>Top formations in the market averages occur in only one of two ways. First, the average moves up to a new high, but does so on low volume. This tells you that the demand for stocks is poor at that point and that the rally is vulnerable. Second, volume surges for several days, but there is very little, if any, upside price progress as measured by market closes. In this latter case, there may not be a pickup in volume when the market initially tops, since the distribution has taken place on the way up. (loc 4026)</p>

<p>**Is that a general principle: When government measures are implemented to counteract a trend, you should sell the rally after the government action? **</p>
<p>Absolutely. It should be written down as an axiom that you always invest against the central banks. When the central banks try to prop up a currency, go the other way. (loc 5537)</p>

<p>This is my view of a year in the life of a trader: Four out of twelve months you are hot. You are so excited that you can’t sleep at night. You can’t wait to get to work the next day; you’re just rolling. Two months out of the year, you are cold. You are so cold, you are miserable. You can’t sleep at night. You can’t figure out where the next trade is going to come from. The other six months out of the year, you make and lose, make and lose. You can’t sleep, because you are trying to figure out how you are going to make money. (loc 6215)</p>

<p>the psychological factor has five areas. These include a well-rounded personal life, a positive attitude, the motivation to make money, lack of conflict, and responsibility for results. Motivation to make money is not significantly correlated with success, but I keep it in the test because lack of such motivation plus high conflict is very significant. (loc 7100)</p>

<p>The composite profile of a losing trader would be someone who is highly stressed and has little protection from stress, has a negative outlook on life and expects the worst, has a lot of conflict in his/her personality, and blames others when things go wrong. Such a person would not have a set of rules to guide their behavior and would be more likely to be a crowd follower. In addition, losing traders tend to be disorganized and impatient. They want action now. (loc 7110)</p>

<p>Stress really takes two forms: worry and the biological fight/flight response. Our brains have a limited capacity for processing information.

<p>The best thing an investor can do, when things go wrong, is to determine how he or she produced those results. Now, I don’t mean that you should blame yourself for your mistakes either. I mean that at some point in time, for any situation, you made a choice that produced those results. Determine what that choice point was and give yourself other options to take when you encounter a similar choice point in the future. Change the decision at similar choice points in the future and you will change the results you get. (loc 7299)</p>

<p>Suppose you are at your desk and you become aware that you are in a mental state that you would like to change. Get up out of the chair. Walk away about four feet and then look at how you looked in that chair. Notice your posture, your breathing, your facial expressions. Then imagine how you would look if you had the sort of mental state you would like. When you can see that clearly, sit down in the chair again and assume the position that you just imagined.

<p>Traders fail not so much because of the trades they make when they are wrong, but rather because of the trades they don’t make when they are right. It is quite common for traders to be right on their market call, but to fail to implement a position and profit from their market assessment. It is not enough being right; you have to make sure that you make money when you are right. (loc 7594)</p>

<p>Avoid annual return targets. Trades should be determined by opportunities, not an artificial goal set by the trader. An annual return expectation will lead a trader to trade too small when opportunities are exceptionally favorable and too large when opportunities are absent. (loc 7706)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An astounding ability to bounce back from failure]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was previously only familiar with Churchill’s tenure as the wartime Prime Minister (and even then, hazily so), but that is only a sliver of his remarkably varied life. Like many of the greats before him, he realised that the chaos of war is a ladder for the ambitious (Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, even Hamilton), and quickly became a leading wartime correspondent. This propelled him to a career in politics, including positions as the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Chancellorship, before ultimately being handed the mantle of PM on the eve of the Battle of Britain (after years of having his warnings about Hitler ignored).</p>
<p>That little summary is a nice highlight reel, but it paints in the broadest of brushstrokes and smoothes over the several considerable failures that Churchill experienced. Churchill’s ability to bounce back from all of these setbacks – the military catastrophe at Gallipoli, being laughed out of parliament after defending Edward VIII during his abdication, and being forced out of various positions by political foes – is one of his defining strengths.</p>
<p>On top of that, he was a master strategist able to dance with multiple levels of abstraction. During the war, he had remarkably clear thinking about postwar geopolitics (for example, the importance of seizing Berlin before the Soviets), while concurrently being inside the details of several pivotal WW2 operations, many of which are now the subject of feature films (<em>Operation Mincemeat</em> , <em>The Imitation Game</em> , <em>Dunkirk</em> ). These, combined with his considerable agency and energy, made him a force of nature.</p>
<p>The biography is quite opinionated. I generally feel that this is a good thing – a combination of fact and author synthesis is more interesting to me than fact alone – though it is quite clear that Johnson is glowingly in favour of Churchill, barely attempting to address the accusations of war crimes in India. But barring this oversight, the biography is a success; Johnson adroitly traces the contours of a fully-lived life in a mere two hundred pages, giving a succinct and entertaining introduction to one of the great figures of the 20th century.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The Russians had manpower but poor equipment, so the Allies wanted to send weapons to help on the Eastern Front.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">But this required clearing out the Dardanelles (narrow strait between the Aegean and the Black Sea), controlled by the Ottoman Turks.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Churchill was strongly in favour of a Dardanelles campaign, but delay from Admiral Fisher and incompetence from Asquith gave the Turks ample time to prepare.</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Churchill’s strengths:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Energy and hard work: he could work extraordinarily hard, but preferred to get eight hours of sleep.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Levels of abstraction: could switch from low-level truth-seeking, in which he wanted facts and material reality, to high level strategy.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Triage – ability to focus on essentials and quickly shift priorities.

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Narrative and oratory: famous speeches, shaping the narrative around Dunkirk, introducing German words satirically (“kaput”).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Positive mindset: full of <em>joie de vivre</em> ; held no grudges against enemies; always recovered from setbacks. He found ways to manage the stresses of life (painting, writing).</li>

</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Churchill’s mistakes:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">His defence of Edward VIII in regards to the abdication, made him extremely unpopular in parliament.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">As chancellor, he defunded the military, leaving the UK under-armed coming into the 1930s.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Ignored the Japanese threat and did not anticipate the invasion of Singapore through Malaya.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">He punted on leverage and almost went bankrupt in 1929.</li>

<p>He daily sipped large quantities of whiskey or brandy, heavily diluted with water or soda. Despite this, his liver, inspected after his death, was found to be as perfect as a young child’s. Churchill was capable of tremendous physical and intellectual efforts, of high intensity over long periods, often with little sleep. But he had corresponding powers of relaxation, filled with a variety of pleasurable occupations, and he also had the gift of taking short naps when time permitted. (loc 74)</p>

<p>He loved the procedure of cigar smoking more than the smoking itself—one reason he never had any smoke-produced trouble with his lungs. […]</p>
<p>As for his consumption of hard liquor, he never gulped but sipped, slowly and at long intervals. (loc 824)</p>

<p>“Mr. Churchill, sir, to what do you attribute your success in life?” Without pause or hesitation, he replied: “Conservation of energy. Never stand up when you can sit down, and never sit down when you can lie down.” (loc 79)</p>

<p>Insofar as Churchill had a religion, it was the British constitution, spirit and letter: Parliament was the church in which he worshipped and whose decisions he obeyed. All this balanced and sanctified the huge power he possessed and exercised. (loc 1246)</p>

<p>He had discovered a new field to conquer with his audacity. Painting, after politics and the family, became his chief passion, and he painted for the rest of his life, as the perfect relaxation from his tremendous cares. (loc 646)</p>

<p>Churchill had a pernicious habit, which did him infinite harm, of overrunning the boundaries between the various government departments and speaking in cabinet—without being invited by the prime minister—on issues which were not his direct concern. (loc 838)</p>

<p>A month later all [of his investments] had gone with the wind as the great Wall Street crash reverberated through the skyscraper canyons. […] McGowan had been investing his funds “on margin” (something Churchill did not understand), so he not only lost all his money but had to buy himself out of the mess. (loc 994)</p>

<p>In 1911 Asquith, hearing the rumbles of war grow louder, transferred Churchill to the Admiralty. (loc 465)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He began the historic switch from coal to oil, and in the process laid down a new class, the Queen Elizabeth, of huge, oil-burning battleships. He created the naval air service, and begged his ship architects to design him aircraft carriers. (loc 477)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Germans began building their High Seas Fleet, as they called it, in the late 1880s, and continued to increase the rate of ship construction, especially of armored, big-gun battleships, over the next twenty years. It was this plainly anti-British construction program which turned public opinion, hitherto pro-German, if anything, against what were now referred to as “the Huns.” (loc 493)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The [First] war, in many ways, proved a disaster for Churchill. But on his downfall, Lord Kitchener, who had been made chief warlord at the outset, reassured him, “There is one thing, at least, they can never take away from you—when the war began you had the fleet ready.” (loc 533)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>So Churchill was out and had to watch, impotent and silent, while the politicians, admirals, and generals compounded their mistakes and the operation, after a quarter of a million casualties, ended in ignominious evacuation. (loc 624)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>So the Dardanelles disaster became identified with Churchill and the fury this aroused persisted until 1940, and even beyond, especially among the Tories and a huge chunk of the public. It was the lowest time in Churchill’s life. (loc 628)</p>

<p>by July 1917 Lloyd George felt strong enough to bring back Churchill and made him minister of munitions. This was a brilliant move, and Churchill rapidly made himself one of the most efficient departmental ministers in British history. It was a confused ministry which had grown up haphazardly during the war and was a maze of duplications, contradictions, and bureaucratic gang warfare. In a short time of fanatical hard work Churchill made it simple, logical, and efficient. He forged a close link with the front to ensure the troops got exactly the right weapons and ammunition they wanted, in the right quantities. He visited the front constantly, and Haig was so impressed by the improvement in supplies that he completely reversed his opinion of Churchill and let him use the Château Verchocq near Calais. (loc 675)</p>

<p>His ideas, when they prospered, sometimes had a huge effect on the future. When they foundered, they left a desolating feeling of what might have been. He regarded Lenin’s Bolshevik coup of November 1917, his subsequent murder of the czar and his family, and the creation of a Communist state as one of the great crimes of history. He was determined to reverse it and sent troops and armies to Russia through Archangel. This intervention had begun before Churchill took over the War Office but he increased its scale and inflated it with his rhetoric, and had he been allowed he would have done more, and for longer. It did not seem to be working, and his colleagues insisted he pull out. Once again, he was “conspicuous,” and got all the blame. In a sense it was another Dardanelles. If it had succeeded, more than 20 million Russian lives would have been saved from starvation, murder, and death in the gulag. It is most unlikely that, with Bolshevism crushed, Mussolini could have come to power in Italy, or still less, Hitler in Germany. (loc 696)</p>

<p>Baldwin, a fellow Old Harrovian, took the opposite view of Churchill to Bonar Law’s: “I would rather have him making private trouble in the Cabinet than public trouble outside it.” He said, half joking, “I wish to make a Cabinet of which Harrow can be proud,” and had Churchill into Number Ten. Churchill was expecting little, and when Baldwin said, “I want you to be Chancellor,” he thought it meant of the Duchy of Lancaster, the nonjob he had held in the dark days of 1915. He was tempted to refuse, when Baldwin added, “Chancellor of the Exchequer, of course.” (loc 854)</p>

<p>Churchill introduced five budgets, each with a two-hour speech of pellucid clarity, superbly delivered in majestic language—the best by far since Gladstone’s golden age and never equaled since. They were immensely popular in Parliament and the country, since they made MPs feel they understood difficult problems of finance and economics, and the population as a whole felt that the man in charge of the national accounts blended prudence and generosity, compassion and common sense, with wit and grandeur. (loc 868)</p>

<p>His first budget, in 1925, was the most celebrated because in it he not only reduced income tax but also brought Britain back to the gold standard at the prewar parity. No decision in the whole of Churchill’s life has been more criticized, then and since. (loc 873)</p>

<p>Churchill was by nature an expansionist, especially in his private finances, where he never stinted but simply worked harder to pay the bills. But over four months he gradually allowed himself to be persuaded to go for gold. (loc 885)</p>
<p>Keynes attacked him with a famous pamphlet, The Economic Consequences of Mr Churchill. After World War II, when Keynesianism became the orthodoxy, Churchill was condemned on all sides and he himself admitted he was wrong. Later still, however, when Thatcherism became the vogue, Churchill was vindicated. (loc 887)</p>

<p>Churchill’s tenure of the exchequer had more serious consequences in a field where he might have been expected to be more sensible: defense. Here he changed his persona completely. From the first lord of the Admiralty who had built up the fleet to over a thousand warships, he reverted to his father’s policy of stinginess to the armed services, […]</p>

<p>[Japan and the Fall of Singapore]</p>
<p>Japan, hitherto a staunch friend of Britain’s, had changed from an ally into a potential enemy. […]</p>
<p>Britain agreed, under pressure from America, which was strongly anti-Japanese, to substitute an international agreement known as the Washington Naval Disarmament Treaty. […]</p>
<p>Churchill’s blindness to the power and intentions of the Japanese extended to the vulnerability of the new base being built in Singapore. […] it never seems to have occurred to him that the Japanese army could overwhelm it by land, sweeping through Malaya. When this happened, of course, he blamed himself—he never shrank from accepting responsibility when it was just—but it must be admitted he was a prime author of the British debacle in the Far East in 1941-42.

<p>To add to Churchill’s difficulties, the one issue on which public opinion was roused—the Italian conquest of Abyssinia—had the effect of working against British interests by driving Italy into Hitler’s arms. Churchill did not care much about the Abyssinian issue, though he opposed the act of aggression in principle, nor did he see Italy (as Anthony Eden did) as a major threat to peace, more dangerous than Hitler. It was one of Churchill’s skills that he could distinguish between levels of power and threat, at any rate in Europe. He thought it was important to keep Italy on Britain’s side, as it had been in the Great War, and so keep the Mediterranean firmly under the control of the Royal Navy and the imperial lifeline to India safe. (loc 1089)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Then the abdication came out of the blue to mesmerize and inflame the nation, to direct attention totally from the external threat, and to show Churchill at his worst. (loc 1106)</p>
<p><em>Churchill gave an excessively strong defense of Edward VIII after his abdication.</em></p>

<p>would the Allies have been better advised to fight over Czechoslovakia in autumn 1938 than over Poland in 1939? Churchill was quite clear at the time that the answer was yes. The British were now rearming, and Churchill was told that by the end of the year Britain’s production of military aircraft would be faster than Germany’s. […]</p>
<p>His case was this: French morale was beginning to sag and it was vital it should not sag further. It had coordinated its army plans in conjunction with the Poles, Yugoslavs, and above all the Czechs. Germany’s claim to the Czech Sudetenland, the essence of the crisis, was designed not to rectify the injustice of Versailles but to knock the Czechs out of the military equation. (loc 1140)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When Hitler occupied Austria in 1938, he not only released four German divisions for service against France but took over six Austrian ones for retraining under the Nazi flag. The Czech business repeated this switch in the military arithmetic on a much bigger scale. (loc 1144)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In January 1939 Hitler took the decision to build an immense fleet of battleships, 3 battle cruisers, 4 aircraft carriers, and no less than 249 submarines. So far as Britain was concerned this was a declaration of war. On March 15 he invaded the remains of Czechoslovakia and annexed them, exactly as Churchill had said. A week later he began to threaten Poland. In April, Mussolini, satisfied that democracy was dead and that “the age of force had arrived,” invaded and annexed Albania. In Spain, the military chiefs led by Franco and assisted by Hitler and Mussolini defeated the republican government. Britain and France guaranteed Poland against invasion, and Chamberlain made feeble attempts to draw Russia into a defensive alliance against Hitler. But Hitler easily trumped that and sent his agents to Moscow to sign a pact with Stalin, under which Poland was to be divided between Nazis and Communists, and Russia given a free hand to annex the Baltic states. This was August 1939. The Nazi invasion of Poland followed inevitably on September 1, and Britain and France declared war two days later. (loc 1169)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Hard as Churchill worked, however, he had little power in the general conduct of the war, which languished in inactivity—it was known as “the Phony War”—leaving the initiative to Hitler. (loc 1199)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Twelve hours earlier the Germans had begun the decisive campaign against France. Early reports were bad as Churchill was forming his cabinet. He did not get to bed till 3:00 a.m. But his courage was high. He recorded: I was conscious of a profound sense of relief. At last I had authority to give directions over the whole scene. I felt as if I were walking with destiny, and that all my past life had been but a preparation for this hour and for this trial. Ten years in the political wilderness had freed me from ordinary party antagonisms. My warnings over the past six years had been so numerous, so detailed and were now so terribly vindicated, that no one could gainsay me. I could not be reproached either for making the war or with want of preparation for it. I thought I knew a good deal about it all and I was sure I would not fail. Therefore, although impatient for the morning, I slept soundly and had no need for cheering dreams. Facts are better than dreams. (loc 1215)</p>

<p>“Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.” The last words were of deadly significance, and felt to be so. For Britain was not facing defeat in the sense that it had been defeated in the American War of Independence. It was facing extinction as a free country. (loc 1261)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>within a month of taking office, amid the unmitigated catastrophe of France’s fall, Churchill was able to report a British victory—Dunkirk—and to speak glowingly of “the Dunkirk spirit.” It was in a sense a bogus victory, for the troops had been forced to leave their heavy equipment behind, and in many cases even their rifles, which they had smashed before embarking. But Dunkirk nevertheless gave a huge boost to British morale: (loc 1273)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the Germans, while overwhelmingly behind the campaign against Versailles, had no desire to see Hitler turn Europe into a servile German empire, let alone lead them into a world war. When Hitler marched into Prague in March 1939 it was his first unpopular act. Until now he had ruled mainly by consent. Thereafter it was by force and fear. (loc 1300)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the first true victory Britain won in the war was the victory of oratory and symbolism. Churchill was responsible for both. (loc 1327)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>By mid-September, the Battle of Britain was won. The sign of defeat was the German decision to switch to night bombing raids on British cities. These caused misery and some loss of civilian life, but the move from hard to soft targets was strategically very welcoming and encouraging for Churchill. As early as August 20 he scented victory and was able to report to the Commons in a speech which contained the memorable tribute to the RAF fighter pilots: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.” (loc 1342)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The moment it became clear that an invasion of Britain was unlikely (Hitler postponed the invasion indefinitely on September 17, 1940), every available aircraft and tank was sent to the Middle East. (loc 1357)</p>
<p><em>Rapid triage and realignment of priorities.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Hitler was soon driven to manufacturing an inferior form of gasoline known as ersatz, one of many German words eagerly adopted by the British (blitz was another) as a subtle sign that they were capable of swallowing the enemy: Churchill encouraged the trend—kaput became a favorite term of his (loc 1361)</p>
<p><em>Words have power</em></p>

<p>the Nazis never suspected their codes were broken and continued to use them to the end. The excerpts persuaded Churchill that Hitler intended to invade Russia in May. By coming to the aid of Italy in Greece, Hitler was forced to postpone the invasion till the second half of June 1941, which in practice made it impossible for him to take Moscow and Leningrad before the winter set in. So the attack on Russia, instead of being a blitzkrieg, became a hard slog. (loc 1381)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>did Churchill save Britain? The answer must be yes. No one else could have done it. This was what was felt at the time by the great majority of the British people, and it has been since confirmed by the facts and documents at our disposal. (loc 1406)</p>

<p>In some ways the first half of 1942 was the worst period of the war for him, for any disasters due to mistakes could no longer be blamed on anyone else. He blamed himself bitterly for underestimating the power and malevolence of Japan, for allowing two capital ships, Prince of Wales and Repulse, to be sent to sea without air cover, both being sunk with almost all hands, and for the fall of Singapore. There were disastrous reverses in North Africa, where Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps proved, for their numbers, the most successful German army of the entire war. Worst of all there were heavy sinkings of Allied supply ships in the North Atlantic, (loc 1432)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Shortly after the tide turned again. Churchill got himself a winning general in Africa in the shape of Bernard Montgomery, who (like Nelson) also possessed a gift for turning himself into a national hero. He beat Rommel at the decisive battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and this prepared the way for Allied landings in North Africa, (loc 1447)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In attacking Germany, Churchill was never held back by humanitarian motives. The destruction of Dresden on the night of February 13-14, 1945, when between 25,000 and 40,000 men, women, and children were killed, was authorized by him personally. (loc 1534)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Overlord might have failed or proved extremely costly had not a highly successful deception plan persuading the Germans that the Normandy landings were a feint and that the real invasion was planned for the Pas de Calais area—another idea of Churchill’s—prevented a massive German counterattack in the early stages. (loc 1555)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The delay occasioned by Churchill’s ensuring the invasion succeeded necessarily meant the Western forces were behind the Russians in pushing into the heart of the Nazi empire. This had grave political consequences. Churchill sought to mitigate them by demanding a full-speed drive to Berlin by the Anglo-American forces. This was supported by Montgomery, the army group commander, who was sure it was possible and would end the war in autumn 1944, with the West in Berlin first. But Eisenhower, the supreme commander, thought it was risky and insisted on a “broad front” advance, which meant that the war continued into the spring of 1945, and that the Russians got to Berlin first—and Prague, Budapest, Vienna, too. (loc 1562)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Churchill wanted to carry on the coalition until Japan surrendered. But the Labour Party refused. So he formed a Tory government, had Parliament (which was now ten years old) dissolved, and reluctantly began an election campaign. […]</p>
<p>The next day came the news: Labour had won nearly 400 seats, the Conservatives were reduced to 210 seats, and Churchill was out. (loc 1617)</p>

<p>No man did more to preserve freedom and democracy and the values we hold dear in the West. None provided more public entertainment with his dramatic ups and downs, his noble oratory, his powerful writings and sayings, his flashes of rage, and his sunbeams of wit. (loc 56)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Winston became not merely adept but masterly in his use of words. And he loved them. They became the verbal current coursing through his veins as he shaped his political manhood. No English statesman has ever loved them more or made more persistent use of them to forward his career and redeem it in time of trouble. (loc 151)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Churchill’s sheer energy and, not least, his ability to switch it off abruptly when not needed were central keys to his life, and especially his wartime leadership. (loc 1294)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He had a historian’s mind, eager to grapple with facts, actualities, to answer the who, how, where, when questions, rather than a philosopher’s, mesmerized by abstractions with their whys and wherefores. (loc 265)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Churchill’s greatest intellectual gift was for picking on essentials and concentrating on them.” But these essentials were always directed toward the destruction of the enemy. (loc 1401)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The first lesson is: always aim high. […] He got himself into five wars in quick succession and became both a veteran of military lore and one of the world’s most experienced (and highly paid) war correspondents. […] He sought power and got it in growing amplitude. He never cadged or demeaned himself to get office, but obtained it on his own terms. (loc 1839)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Lesson number two is: there is no substitute for hard work. He worked hard at everything to the best of his ability: Parliament, administration, geopolitics and geostrategy, writing books, painting, creating an idyllic house and garden, seeing things and if possible doing things for himself. Mistakes he made, constantly, but there was never anything shoddy or idle about his work. He put tremendous energy into everything, and was able to do this because (as he told me) he conserved and husbanded his energy, too. (loc 1850)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Third, and in its way most important, Churchill never allowed mistakes, disaster—personal or national—accidents, illnesses, unpopularity, and criticism to get him down. His powers of recuperation, both in physical illness and in psychological responses to abject failure, were astounding. (loc 1854)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Fourth, Churchill wasted an extraordinarily small amount of his time and emotional energy on the meannesses of life: recrimination, shifting the blame onto others, malice, revenge seeking, dirty tricks, spreading rumors, harboring grudges, waging vendettas. Having fought hard, he washed his hands and went on to the next contest. (loc 1862)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Joy was a frequent visitor to Churchill’s psyche, banishing boredom, despair, discomfort, and pain. He liked to share his joy, and give joy. It must never be forgotten that Churchill was happy with people. (loc 1869)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A technical analysis trading journal]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brandt&#39;s <em>Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader</em> has the noble goal of demonstrating a play-by-play account of real risk-taking using the author’s technical trading approach.</p>
<p>I believe that the Midwit meme (the one where the left and right side of the bell curve arrive at the same conclusion) exists for technical analysis. I personally think TA can add value to a discretionary trading process, a view shared by many people I respect in the business (see the <em>Market Wizards</em> interviews with Bruce Kovner, or a book like <a href="https://www.notion.so/Alpha-Trader-3d61255d7d5049998f11155f4217c409">Alpha Trader</a> for a more detailed discussion). An offhand dismissal of TA is a sign that your interlocutor has the closed mind of a midwit; Ted Lasso&#39;s quip that one should &quot;be curious, not judgmental&quot; is especially true in markets.</p>
<p>All this said, it does seem to me that the &quot;technical analysis only&quot; approach espoused by Brandt is more reminiscent of the widespread retail use of TA, which generally parts fools with their money, instead of the intelligent application adopted by the Market Wizards. Brandt&#39;s analysis can come across as naive, simplistic, and even inconsistent – he doesn&#39;t always follow his own rules. Interpreted charitably, this is a feature of the book rather than a bug. It demonstrates that even for an experienced practitioner whose system two brain knows the importance of discipline, it is hard to stop system one from kicking in during the heat of battle. What confuses me is that despite my criticisms, Brandt has an enviable track record. This track record, if legitimate, means that he has identified some truths about markets, even if he is not always able to convey them in the text.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think there is wisdom in this <em>Diary</em> . If a trader is able to put their money on the line over many years without blowing up, that alone means there is something to be learned. But I find it difficult to recommend this book generally.</p>

<p>I trade breakouts of classical chart formations such as head and shoulders tops and bottoms, rectangles, channels, triangles, and the like. I focus on weekly and daily chart patterns that form over a period of four weeks to many months. Even though my focus on charts is longer term, my actual trading tends to be short term, with trades lasting anywhere from a day or two (in the case of losses) to a month or two.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Last Day Rule is the principal method used in the Factor Trading Plan to determine the initial protective stop order once a position is entered. If a pattern breakout is valid, then it logically follows that the day of the breakout is a significant event. Ideally, I establish a position at the point of a price breakout and use the low of an upside breakout day or the high of a downside breakout day to set my protective stop levels. This is called the Last Day Rule.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The Weekend Rule basically states that a market that decisively moves into new high or low ground on a Friday is very likely to continue the move on Monday and early Tuesday of the next week. The reasoning behind the Weekend Rule is that a decisive new high or low on Friday indicates the willingness of “strong hands” to take a position home for a weekend.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that candlestick charts in their earliest form were developed in the 18th century by a legendary Japanese rice trader named Homma Munehisa. Munehisa realized that there was a link between the price of rice and its supply-and-demand factors, but that market price was also driven by the emotions of market participants. The principles behind candlestick charts provided Munehisa a method to graphically view the prices over a period of time and gain an edge over his trading competitors. An edge is all that a speculator can ever expect.</p>

<p>There is a huge difference between being short a market because of a chart pattern and being “bearish” on the fundamentals of a market because of the same chart pattern.</p>
<p><em>This is a relatively insightful point, echoed by Bruce Kovner in Market Wizards. The chart pattern should be used to make a statement on the fundamentals and market sentiment, rather than naively as a trading signal.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>To be a valid breakout, I also want to see a market penetrate the most recent high or low price that defined the boundary. And to be most comfortable with a trade, I want to see a market penetrate the highest or lowest price within the completed boundary.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I greatly prefer to trade a pattern that offers a horizontal or flat boundary, such as the boundaries of a rectangle, ascending triangle, H&amp;S, etc. I consider such patterns to be horizontal. The reason these are superior patterns for trading is that the penetration of a boundary line most often occurs simultaneously with the violation of a major or minor high or low point within the pattern.</p>
<p><em>There is a more important reason to believe in horizontal boundaries: they represent “levels” at which people are stepping into buy, which based on my own experiences in markets, definitely exist! People do make statements like “I am a buyer of oil below $70”, and certainly governments can have implicit or explicit “strikes”.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As a general rule, genuine H&amp;S tops and bottoms must be characterized by three features:</p>
<ol>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Remembering that an H&amp;S pattern is most often a reversal pattern, there must be a trend to be reversed in order for an H&amp;S interpretation to be valid.</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>The right and left shoulders must overlap—and the more overlap the better. If the right and left shoulders do not overlap, then there is no H&amp;S pattern.</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>There must be some symmetry to the shoulders in terms of duration or height in order to validate an H&amp;S pattern. A final point: I greatly prefer a flat neckline or one that slants in the direction of the anticipated trend. I do not like upslanting necklines in H&amp;S tops or downslanting necklines in H&amp;S bottoms.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory is a fickle mistress]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am somewhat saddened by the fact that it’s been <em>five years</em> since I last read Nabokov. Over all that time, could I really not have carved out a few gentle hours to enjoy the work of an author who never disappoints?</p>
<p><em>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</em> initially seems to be cut from a similar cloth to other Nabokov classics – the reader must piece together the fictional reality from the account of a narrator whose reliability is highly questionable: Kinbote in <em>Pale Fire</em> , Hermann in <em>Despair</em>, and of course Humbert Humbert in <em>Lolita</em> . The parallel to <em>Pale Fire</em> is notable; in both <em>The Real Life</em> and <em>Pale Fire</em> we have a narrator, writing a biographical account of a more successful literary counterpart, who can’t resist projecting their own story onto that of the subject. However, it turns out that <em>The Real Life</em> is markedly less sinister. Rather than being primarily a psychoanalysis of the narrator, unwittingly revealed by the narrator themselves, the novel is a study of the revisionist nature of memory and the contrast between lived experience and external appearance.</p>
<p>Unlike Kinbote, <em>The Real Life’s</em> narrator <em>V.</em> is somewhat self-aware – he is not only struggling to paint a clear picture of his half-brother Sebastian Knight, he is recounting his struggle and exploring the fallibility of his own rose-tinted memories. But <em>V.</em> is not perfect either. His obsessive investigations reveal deep insecurity, perhaps even seeing Sebastian as a father figure of sorts after their traumatic upbringing.</p>
<p>I have not yet commented on the astonishing beauty of Nabokov’s prose, because that is table stakes in a Nabokov novel.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable to me that <em>The Real Life</em> was one of Nabokov’s first English novels, given its deep maturity and thematic complexity (of the ones I have read, it is perhaps second only to <em>Pale Fire</em> in this regard). While several Nabokov novels make allusions to the author’s own life (e.g. the Russian emigré we see in <em>Pnin</em>, but hopefully not Humbert in Lolita), even by Nabokovian standards, <em>The Real Life</em> is deeply self-referential, with lines between author, narrator, and narrated blurring before ultimately coming to delightful fusion in the novel’s climax. On a side note, reading this has made me want to revisit Calvino’s <em>If on a winter night a traveller</em> – after reading a metafictional exploration of the writing progress, perhaps a metafictional exploration of the reading process would be a good complement?</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>My father’s first marriage had not been happy. A strange woman, a restless reckless being – but not my father’s kind of restlessness. His was a constant quest which changed its object only after having attained it. Hers was a half-hearted pursuit, capricious and rambling, now swerving wide off the mark, now forgetting it midway, as one forgets one’s umbrella in a taxicab. (loc 74)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In his last published book, The Doubtful Asphodel (1936), Sebastian depicts an episodical character who has just escaped from an unnamed country of terror and misery. ‘What can I tell you of my past, gentlemen [he is saying], I was born in a land where the idea of freedom, the notion of right, the habit of human kindness were things coldly despised and brutally outlawed. Now and then, in the course of history, a hypocrite government would paint the walls of the nation’s prison a comelier shade of yellow and loudly proclaim the granting of rights familiar to happier states; but either these rights were solely enjoyed by the jailers or else they contained some secret flaw which made them even more bitter than the decrees of frank tyranny … Every man in the land was a slave, if he was not a bully; since the soul and everything pertaining to it were denied to man, the infliction of physical pain came to be considered as sufficient to govern and guide human nature … From time to time a thing called revolution would occur, turning the slaves into bullies and vice versa … A dark country, a hellish place, gentlemen, and if there is anything of which I am certain in life it is that I shall never exchange the liberty of my exile for the vile parody of home …’ Owing to there being in this character’s speech a chance reference to ‘great woods and snow-covered plains’, Mr Goodman promptly assumes that the whole passage tallies with Sebastian Knight’s own attitude to Russia. This is a grotesque misconception; it should be quite clear to any unbiased reader that the quoted words refer rather to a fanciful amalgamation of tyrannic iniquities than to any particular nation or historical reality. (loc 274)</p>
<p><em>Narrator bias creeps in – it has been established that V. has rosy memories of their time in Russia, and some of the facts of Knight’s life like his early escape to England and his reluctance to use the Russian tongue do lean in favour of Goodman’s interpretation.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I find it impossible to believe that Sebastian, no matter how gruesome the aspect of Russia was at the time of our escape, did not feel the wrench we all experienced. All things considered, it had been his home, and the set of kindly, well-meaning, gentle-mannered people driven to death or exile for the sole crime of their existing, was the set to which he too belonged. (loc 293)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘Good luck,’ he said, ‘cheerio’ – and shook my hand in the limp self-conscious fashion he had acquired in England. Suddenly for no earthly reason I felt immensely sorry for him and longed to say something real, something with wings and a heart but the birds I wanted settled on my shoulders and head only later when I was alone and not in need of words. (loc 355)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As I looked about me, all things in that bedroom seemed to have just jumped back in the nick of time as if caught unawares, and now were gradually returning my gaze, trying to see whether I had noticed their guilty start. (loc 407)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>don’t be too certain of learning the past from the lips of the present. Beware of the most honest broker. Remember that what you are told is really threefold: shaped by the teller, reshaped by the listener, concealed from both by the dead man of the tale. Who is speaking of Sebastian Knight? repeats that voice in my conscience. Who indeed? His best friend and his half-brother. A gentle scholar, remote from life, and an embarrassed traveller visiting a distant land. And where is the third party? Rotting peacefully in the cemetery of St Damier. Laughingly alive in five volumes. Peering unseen over my shoulder as I write this (although I dare say he mistrusted too strongly the commonplace of eternity to believe even now in his own ghost). (loc 594)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘I cannot help feeling there is something essentially wrong about love. Friends may quarrel or drift apart, close relations too, but there is not this pang, this pathos, this fatality which clings to love. Friendship never has that doomed look. Why, what is the matter? I have not stopped loving you, but because I cannot go on kissing your dim dear face, we must part, we must part. Why is it so? What is this mysterious exclusiveness? One may have a thousand friends, but only one love-mate. (loc 1320)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Good-bye. Go away, go away. Don’t write. Marry Charlie or any other good man with a pipe in his teeth. Forget me now, but remember me afterwards, when the bitter part is forgotten. (loc 1332)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He would not mind perhaps having a bite at the apple of sin because, apart from solecisms, he was indifferent to the idea of sin; but he did mind apple-jelly, potted and patented. (loc 1783)</p>
<p><em>Avoidance of cliched sin.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘Oh-la-la!’ she exclaimed getting very red in the face. ‘Mon Dieu! The Russian gentleman died yesterday, and you’ve been visiting Monsieur Kegan …’ So I did not see Sebastian after all, or at least I did not see him alive. But those few minutes I spent listening to what I thought was his breathing changed my life as completely as it would have been changed, had Sebastian spoken to me before dying. Whatever his secret was, I have learnt one secret too, and namely: that the soul is but a manner of being – not a constant state – that any soul may be yours, if you find and follow its undulations. The hereafter may be the full ability of consciously living in any chosen soul, in any number of souls, all of them unconscious of their interchangeable burden. Thus – I am Sebastian Knight. I feel as if I were impersonating him on a lighted stage, with the people he knew coming and going – the dim figures of the few friends he had, the scholar, and the poet; and the painter – smoothly and noiselessly paying their graceful tribute; (loc 2475)</p>
<p><em>The interaction between subjective experience and external reality… perhaps also a comment on the literary experience? We are made to feel deeply about a character that is merely a construction. The protagonist’s soul becomes ours.</em></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global chip supply chains are mind-numbingly complex]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Chip War</em> is a delightful introduction to the chip industry – a story full of colourful characters, corporate backstabbing, and murky geopolitics… which appears to be a running theme with these globally critical industries.</p>
<p>Miller pitches the book at an ideal level of abstraction, without unnecessary minutiae. He explains the basic science insofar as it gives insight into the current dynamics of the chip industry; he gives biographical details that drive the narrative rather than for the sake of completeness. Two examples follow. Photolithography – the process by which ultraviolet light is used chemically “print” patterns onto circuit boards – is explained to contextualise the remarkable fact that almost all of the world’s advanced lithography machines are built by just one company, ASML in the Netherlands. The prickly personality of William Shockley, the undeniably brilliant co-inventor of the transistor (and Nobel laureate in physics), is only pointed out because it is one of the factors that led Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore to quit Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor, and later Intel.</p>
<p>The evolution of the chip industry was a delicate weave between technological progress and business thinking. For example, Bob Noyce boldly betting on Moore’s law by cutting prices before it seemed remotely sensible to do so: “Moore later argued that Noyce’s price cuts were as big an innovation as the technology inside Fairchild’s integrated circuits”. Concepts like Christensen’s “innovators dilemma” were essentially forged in the fire of chip industry competition – Christensen advised Andy Grove on Intel’s famed pivot from a DRAM manufacturer (a highly commoditised memory chip) to microprocessors, “tantamount to Ford exiting the car business”.</p>
<p>Miller’s exposition of the current structure of the industry was deeply fascinating and somewhat disconcerting. For example, the industry is highly concentrated and seemingly fragile: consider TSMC’s &gt;60% market share in chip fabrication and ASML’s aforementioned stranglehold on lithography, not to mention the strategic importance of specialised chips in both previous and future cold wars.</p>
<p><em>Chip War</em> is a welcome change of pace from minutiae-ridden tomes like <a href="/?books=the-prize" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Prize</a>. It is accessible, succinct, and genuinely exciting. I’d also recommend <a href="/?books=the-world-for-sale" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The World for Sale</a> as a book of similar flavour. Both of these pieces are first-rate occupants of that narrow middle of the Venn diagram, intersecting “critically important” and “poorly understood”, and as such, they are indispensable resources for understanding material reality.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excellent introduction to rates markets]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An excellent introduction to interest rate markets. Wiseman explains with succinct clarity why various instruments exist and centres the discussion on concrete cases: for example, banks generally want to borrow floating-rate cash flows to match their floating-rate liabilities, while insurance companies would prefer to lend at a fixed rate, and it is interest rate swaps allow the twain to meet. Similarly, if investors want to receive coupons in pounds sterling but a company wants to borrow in USD, a cross-currency basis swap allows both parties to have their desired cash flows. The discussion of repos and eurodollars, two massively important but widely misunderstood concepts, is first rate.</p>
<p>While <em>Pricing Money</em> is explicitly pitched as a beginners guide and thus does not deeply explore the manifold mathematical intricacies of the instruments, Wiseman gives a great overview of the numerous conventions used in rates markets, which often feel like they exist purely to make the space more impenetrable to outsiders. It’s not surprising that <em>Pricing Money</em> is so highly recommended to junior rates traders!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Definitive (excessively so) tome on the history of oil]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Prize</em> is the definitive text on the tumultuous history of oil. The first surprise of the book is that oil is a surprisingly modern innovation – it found its first widespread use as a lighting fuel in the mid-19th century and morphed into the strategic geopolitical lifeblood it is today as a result of the automobile revolution and the World Wars. Indeed, meaningful quantities of oil were discovered on the Arabian peninsula no sooner than 1938!</p>
<p>Yergin’s deeply-researched narrative places oil at the centre of 20th-century world history, especially as a cause, catalyst, and constraint of military action. The discussions of the World Wars, the Suez Crisis, and Iran (both Mossadegh and the Iranian revolution) were the highlights of the book – oil aside, <em>The Prize</em> is a great exposition of these fascinating periods of modern history.</p>
<p>Eloquent and detailed as Yergin may be, I find the text somewhat troubling from a philosophy-of-history perspective. For example, if someone went through history with the thesis that “weather is the most important determinant”, they would perhaps be able to construct a similarly coherent narrative, perhaps citing the rains that helped Constantine triumph over Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge, the storms that afflicted the Spanish Armada as they attempted to conquer England, or the various military campaigns stifled by Russian winters. I have no doubt that oil has played a remarkably important role in modern history, but some of the claims are a little fanciful, for instance: “The advantages of 100-octane gasoline were proved in the Battle of Britain in 1940, when the 100-octane-powered British Spitfires outperformed the Messerschmitt 109s, fueled on 87-octane gasoline. Some attributed Britain&#39;s critical edge and victory in that life-and-death air battle to the 100-octane gasoline“.</p>
<p>Yergin would also have you believe that oil was the binding constraint for both Rommel and Tojo in WW2’s North African and Pacific theatres respectively. The case here is more convincing, but the selection bias is still hard to strip out; for example, Chris Miller in <em>Chip War</em> quips that “steel and aluminium” shaped the outcome of World War II, rather than oil.</p>
<p>Philosophy of history aside, my bigger qualm with <em>The Prize</em> is that it is your typical “boring history book” – a massive tome that goes into excruciating detail. I suspect history books are like this because the author, having spent so much effort unearthing these minutiae, is loath to part with them. I have a deep respect for historians (or writers) who do in-depth research, and then apply their expertise to filter out the noise in a bold and opinionated way, cutting through the thicket to identify an arc of history. To misquote Cicero, if only Yergin had more time, he may have been able to write a shorter book!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disturbing memoir of a downwards spiral]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A rather distressing memoir about the author’s tumultuous life: from being an Oxford physics graduate and cricket Blue, to entering the world of commodities trading at its degenerate heyday (chronicled in <a href="/?books=the-world-for-sale" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The World for Sale</a>), to his subsequent descent into self-destruction, divorce, and financial ruin.</p>
<p>The author is intelligent and self-aware, but that almost makes it worse because both the reader and the author can see the Shakespearean inevitability of his downwards spiral. I chose to read the book as a cautionary tale, given the ostensible similarities between the author and myself. But truthfully, this is not a book many people should read because it is very heavy stuff (by the author’s own admission the book is essentially a suicide note), and most of the anecdotes will not be of interest unless you trade commodities.</p>
<p>The takeaways for me are: you cannot get into a spiral of blaming yourself for things (which is especially hard in trading), you must live within your current and expected future means, and you must be sure that decisions you make are not subconscious attempts to punish yourself. Self-worth is reflexive – if you believe it, you achieve things that make it easier to believe – and it must be preserved.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>MDD</em> came quite highly recommended from FinTwit. But the book is nothing special – it is a collection of momentum indicators and technical analysis methods. The methods weren’t particularly well explained, nor was there much insight conveyed. Anyway, in my experience (notably I am not a trend-following quant so this experience is quite limited), having so many different indicators, each with their own hyperparameters, is a recipe for an overfitting disaster.</p>
<p>All of the value I got from the book was in the first two chapters, which do contain genuinely good insights into the properties of moving average filters – this is what elevated the book to two stars. For example, by thinking of moving averages as convolutions, we can reason about the types of trends that a particular moving average window or kernel will be most sensitive to.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Volatility, Fat Tails, and Tail Risk hedging]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Unperturbed by Volatility</em> has quite a different flavour to other textbooks on options trading and volatility. Indeed, it advertises itself as a book on risk rather than a book on options – volatility and financial derivatives are discussed in the context of risk, but so are other topics.</p>
<p>For instance, I was previously quite unfamiliar with the statistics of fat tails (and somewhat unwilling to read Taleb’s <em>Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails</em> ), so it was a relief to have the first two chapters of <em>Unperturbed</em> focussing heavily on the practicalities of modelling asset returns with fat-tailed distributions.</p>
<p>While the book is occasionally heavy-going with theory, this is nicely balanced by practicality in the form of simulation-based experiments and studies on market data. A good example is their simulations on the convergence of the mean absolute deviation as an estimator for sample standard deviation. Surprisingly, under fat tails the MAD outperforms the sample stdev as an estimator for volatility.</p>
<p>On the volatility/options front, <em>Unperturbed</em> covers substantially the same topics you would find in other similar resources, like Sinclair’s <a href="/?books=volatility-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Volatility Trading</a> and Bennett’s <em>Trading Volatility</em> (both of which I think are slightly clearer).</p>
<p><em>Unperturbed</em> is not suitable for a beginner and it could do with some editing – the writing is a little disorganised and my edition contained numerous typos. But where it shines is in the integration of various concepts that are deeply related to volatility – the statistics of fat tails, portfolio construction, tail risk hedging – which other texts generally do not address. There’s gold in these hills for those willing to dig.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A gentle book on the damnedest of lies. Huff gives a guided tour of statistical chicanery, outlining several classic ways that statistics are abused, in a light-hearted and approachable format.</p>
<p>These are relatively basic ideas that most of the people reading this review are hopefully familiar with already – mean vs median, small sample biases, abuse of y-axis scaling etc – but given the ubiquity of statistics shenanigans, it’s always useful to have the refresher. To summarise, the five questions one should ask of any statistical conclusion:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Who is giving the statistic and what biases do they have</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How do they know? What is the sample size and statistical significance</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">What data or analysis has been omitted</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Does the statistical finding support the conclusion</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Does it make sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there weren’t any new concepts for me personally, this would be a good book for curious middle-school students.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aspiration → Ambitions → Actions]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Earned Life</em> is about long-term fulfilment and regret minimisation. Goldsmith believes that these come from living a life in which day-to-day decisions and efforts align with an overarching purpose – where our <strong>actions</strong> build towards <strong>ambitions</strong> (goals) that are consistent with our <strong>aspirations</strong> (who we want to be).</p>
<p>There are valuable concepts in this book. A few that stood out were:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The “Every Breath” paradigm: every breath is a new you, who should be unburdened by previous mistakes and ready to achieve new things.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Action, Ambition and Aspiration: a reminder that it requires an active effort to intertwine these.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Eating the marshmallow: sometimes you have to eat the marshmallow (in the context of the marshmallow experiment).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Success factors: motivation, ability, understanding, confidence, support, and a receptive market.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Life Plan Review: a procedure for ensuring that your day-to-day actions are aligned with your ambitions and aspirations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also enjoyed the thought exercises at the end of each chapter. Even simple questions like “Who are your heroes” were quite thought-provoking in the context of the book. If someone is your hero, are your actions and ambitions consistent with your aspiration to be like that hero?</p>
<p>But while the book has been helpful for me (I’m even adopting some of the processes like the LPR), I’d struggle to call it a good book. It’s vague, full of cliches, and often lacks a clear flow. This is not helped by the constant injection of loosely-related anecdotes (the author is a CEO coach… which is generally not encouraging) and the “motivational speaker” vibes. I think <a href="/?books=how-will-you-measure-your-life" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">How Will You Measure Your Life</a> is overall a better read on the regret-minimisation front, but <em>The Earned Life</em> does give reasonable practical protocols.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Core premise</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>We are living an earned life when the choices, risks, and effort we make in each moment align with an overarching purpose in our lives, regardless of the eventual outcome. (loc 411)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What we’re addressing here is supersized existential regret, the kind that reroutes destinies and persecutes our memory for decades. Existential regret is deciding not to have children, then changing our mind too late. It’s allowing our soulmate to become “the one who got away.” It’s turning down the perfect job because we doubt ourselves far more than do the folks who want to hire us. It’s not taking our studies seriously in school. It’s looking back in retirement and wishing we’d allowed ourselves more leisure time to develop interests outside work. (loc 330)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>ONE OF OUR guiding concepts here is that our lives reside on a continuum that roams between Regret and Fulfillment, (loc 354)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>an earned life makes only a few demands of us: Live your own life, not someone else’s version of it. Commit yourself to “earning” every day. Make it a habit. Attach your earning moments to something greater than mere personal ambition. (loc 462)</p>
<p><em>The dig at personal ambition is sort of inconsistent with the rest of this book.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This is the secret of living an earned life: It is lived at the extremes. You are maximizing what you need to do, minimizing what you deem unnecessary. (loc 1333)</p>
<p><em>I am cautious about this because people’s utility functions change. If you maximise based on your present utility function you may live to regret it. However, this approach works if you are constantly course-correcting your goals.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ambition is the pursuit of a specific goal with a finish line; we are X, we want to achieve Y. When we hit Y, our specific ambition ends, until we come up with our next ambitious goal. Aspiration, on the other hand, is a continuing act of self-creation and self-validation. (loc 1499)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Any positive, lasting self-improvement we earn in life derives from Action working in concert with Ambition and Aspiration. (loc 1505)</p>

<p>Over time, with enough “evidence,” our parents subdivide us into distinct personalities: the smart one, pretty one, strong one, nice one, responsible one—whichever of the many descriptors seems to apply at the time. (loc 817)</p>

<p>As the great journalist Herbert Bayard Swope (winner of the first Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1917) said, “I can’t give you a surefire formula for success. But I can give you a formula for failure: Try to please everybody all the time.” (loc 842)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Parental influence. Obligation. Mental block. Peer pressure. Not enough time. Inertial devotion to the status quo. These are the perennial barriers that freeze us in place and leave us yearning for a new path yet unable to take the first step on that path. (loc 933)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you find that you’re living the same day every day, you could ask yourself the same question: Am I living my current life because it’s how I choose to find fulfillment, or because I can’t imagine an alternative? An honest answer is essential, but possibly too painful to bear. (loc 1038)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When we are frustrated with our life or career and yearn for something more gratifying, it may be emotionally soothing to imagine a life that’s 180 degrees removed from our current predicament. But the odds of success favor the people who do not stray too far from their expertise, experience, and relationships. (loc 1191)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>That doesn’t mean we’re restricted to small and incremental change in our lives. The change can be huge. But it requires adjacency—some connection, however indirect, to our track record of accomplishment. (loc 1193)</p>

<p>The objective of the Life Plan Review, or LPR, is to close the gap between what you plan to do in your life and what you actually get done. (loc 2506)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Step 1. In the LPR, you and each member of the weekly meeting take turns reporting your answers to a fixed set of six questions that have been documented to improve your life. “Did I do my best to…” Set clear goals? Make progress toward achieving my goals? Find meaning? Be happy? Maintain and build positive relationships? Be fully engaged? You answer each question by reporting a number on a 1 to 10 scale (10 being the best) that measures your <strong>level of effort</strong>, (loc 2525)</p>
<p>Step 2. In the days between the weekly LPR meetings you track these questions daily—to create the habit of self-monitoring. (loc 2528)</p>
<p>Step 3. Review your plan for relevance and personal need once a week. When you measure effort, you are monitoring the quality of your trying. But from time to time you should also review the purpose of your trying. Are you making a meaningful effort to achieve a now meaningless goal? (loc 2547)</p>

<p>DO THIS: List the twenty or so people in your career with whom you communicate most frequently over, say, a three-month period.

<p>FEEDFORWARD “Feedforward” is a word I started using after a conversation with John Katzenbach when I began coaching CEOs. It was my counterpoint to “feedback,” the more common term for an exchange of workplace opinion. Whereas feedback comprises people’s opinion of your past behavior, feedforward represents other people’s ideas that you should be using in the future. […]</p>
<p>After you pick the one behavior you intend to change, make your intention known in a one-on-one conversation with someone you know. Ask that person—it could be anyone, not necessarily a co-worker—for two suggestions that might help you achieve your goal. Listen without judgment, then say “Thank you.” (loc 2355)</p>

<p>Being motivated is not merely a supercharged emotional state induced by having a goal. It is that heightened emotional state coupled with a supercharged impulse to do each of the specific tasks required to achieve that goal. It is incorrect to say that you are motivated to make money or lose weight or become fluent in Mandarin, even if you feel such statements are true, unless you consistently do the big and small things required to achieve such goals.

<p>That’s the beauty of confidence. It is the product of all your other positive virtues and choices, and then it returns the favor by making you even stronger in those areas. As a general rule, if you have motivation, ability, and understanding, lacking confidence is unfortunate, almost inexcusable. You have earned the right to be confident. (loc 1101)</p>

<p>Within a short time he developed a methodology that measured what he called Talent to Value. Analyzing Unilever’s three hundred thousand employees through a proprietary formula, he concluded that just fifty-six people at Unilever were responsible for 90 percent of its value. […] These people, Sandy also learned, were invariably specialists—and their value was embedded in that term: They were “special.” Pay them whatever it takes to keep them, he said. (loc 1956)</p>

<p>Do not confuse “one-trick genius” with the pejorative “one-trick pony.” The term “one-trick pony” is judgmental and denigrating, referring to people who abuse a limited skill set—whether it’s the same predictable response to every situation or one slick move on the basketball court—because they have no choice. It’s all they’ve got. OTG, by contrast, is a deeply considered choice, representing what we aspire to rather than what we settle for. (loc 1990)</p>

<p>At first glance, CEOs appear to be the ultimate generalists. But peel away the necessary but generalized leadership skills of clear communication, persuasion, and decision making, and you’ll find that every good CEO has a very specific skill or core value that they regard as their OTG. One CEO’s OTG might be running a productive meeting; another’s might be creating total alignment at every level of the organization. The genius in each CEO’s trick is that this isolated skill is the foundation of the CEO’s credibility and respect; it governs everything. (loc 2027)</p>

<p>I believe our problem with approval, like our problem with asking for help, starts at the top. My experience with successful leaders is that they’re sensitive to employees’ need for approval and recognition and are very adept at providing it. But for the same reasons they won’t admit they need help, they’re reluctant to acknowledge their own need for approval or recognition. A leader’s internal sense of validation—i.e., self-approval—should be enough, they tell themselves. Anything else is grandstanding, the equivalent of turning on the Applause sign for yourself. Net result: the CEO’s attitude filters down the line until approval and recognition are denied their rightful place throughout the organization. (loc 2860)</p>

<p>One of the more common excuses is a variation on the well-known concept of loss aversion—our impulse to avoid a loss is greater than our desire to acquire an equivalent gain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindset, methodology, mathematics]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Alpha Trader</em> is an incredible book for discretionary traders, utterly packed with insights, with a strong emphasis on the mindset aspect of trading. A huge portion of this game is building processes that prevent our worst system-one instincts from running amok. Donnelly puts it thus:</p>
<p>He investigates, with reference both to his personal experiences and a study of the cognitive science literature, which psychological traits are most likely to lead to trading success – conscientiousness and rationality come out on top. The discussion of cognitive biases was surprisingly insightful. I say “surprisingly” because the topic comes up so often that I wasn’t expecting to learn many new things, but Donnelly expertly contextualises the cognitive biases, highlighting flavours of them that are specifically related to trading, For example, he describes the “chasing bias” (which I have noticed in myself) – the tendency for people to want to put on trades in the direction of the market (e.g. buy when it’s going up), which is sort of a combination of recency bias, system one FOMO, etc.</p>
<p>The second half of the book shifts the spotlight towards methodology (while still reiterating the importance of mindset). Donnelly explains how he thinks about narrative, sentiment, and portfolio management. The discussion is very pragmatic, taking into account not just individual human biases but organisational constraints. For example, Donnelly espouses the Mike Platt view (see his <a href="/?books=hedge-fund-market-wizards" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Hedge Fund Market Wizards</a> interview) that trader profits should be structured like a call option, meaning that you increase your bet sizes as you make more PnL. There are many other valuable ideas here, so valuable in fact that I don’t feel it is appropriate to discuss them further here.</p>
<p>All said, I place this book in a similar category to <a href="/?books=trader-construction-kit" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Trader Construction Kit</a> – ”required reading” for anyone on a trading desk – though Alpha Trader is slightly more focused on trading mindset and philosophy as opposed to <em>TCK</em> ’s emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts practicalities, which though necessary, are sometimes dry. <em>Alpha Trader</em> is an unequivocal must-read for any aspiring discretionary trader.</p>

<p>A rigid mindset, negative mental loops and low energy will derail the best-laid plans and render even the most carefully planned process, strategy, and tactics all but worthless. Without the right attitude, there can be no sustained success in trading. (loc 6986)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Alpha Traders are smart, rational, disciplined, flexible, patient, and aggressive… They have the endurance to handle unending ups, downs, hills, and valleys. They come in fired up each day to solve the ultimate puzzle and they get paid incredibly well if they succeed. Alpha Traders work hard (even when they don’t feel like it), seek to continuously improve, and love markets more than they love money. (loc 221)</p>

<p>If you take nothing else from this book, remember these six points: The first rule of trading is: Don’t blow up. To succeed in trading, you must be rational, and you need to put in the work. It’s OK to be wrong. Variance is part of trading. Deal with it. There is no single trading methodology that will work always and forever. Trading should be fun (most of the time). (loc 7420)</p>

<p>Richard Wiseman, who has spent years researching luck, set up a variety of interesting experiments to show that luck is not really luck. In one experiment, he placed a $20-dollar bill on the ground in the path of students and found that those that self-identified as lucky were much more likely to notice and pick up the $20 bill than the others.

<p>Try not to focus on your YTD P&amp;L too much. Come in each day and do your best. Each year is only around 250 trading days. Take them one at a time and do your very best each day. Let the YTD P&amp;L take care of itself. (loc 685)</p>

<p>There is a wide body of literature covering process vs. outcome. As a rule, you should view your trading P&amp;L as a semi-random output of your process. You control the process, but you do not control the short-term outcome in trading. The sooner you understand this, the better. (loc 1424)</p>

<p>Think forward. Think forward. Think forward. Spend most of your time thinking about the future path of markets and how you can predict and capitalize on that path. Spend as little time as possible thinking about trades that happened earlier today or yesterday or six weeks ago. The time to look back is when you are consciously in process-analysis mode, looking thoughtfully back on your trades and trading patterns in recent weeks or months. Otherwise, think forward.

<p>Your default mode should always be to do nothing. Flat is the most powerful position in trading. When you have no position, you are unbiased, ready to pounce, and unconstrained by any prior view or notions. You are not anchored on any price or level. You are most open-minded and nimble when you have no position. (loc 3072)</p>

<p>there can also be the problem of negative extrapolation. That is: it has never happened before so it can’t happen now. This is a failure of imagination. The best outlook is to always consider almost any possibility, no matter how unlikely. This does not mean you need to position for extremely low probability outcomes; you just need to consider them.

<p>Chasing bias is the tendency to enter trades in a security simply because it is moving. Something rallies, and you want to buy it. Something sells off and you want to sell it. Rid yourself of this bias. It is a weakness that plagues many traders, even hedge fund professionals. It is essentially a combination of activity bias (the need to be active even when doing nothing would be a better choice) and extrapolation bias (“It went down so it’s gonna keep going down!”) Bad traders see price moving on the screen and think somebody knows something. Good traders know 97% of all price action is noise. (loc 3827)</p>

<p>Grizzly bias. Compulsive bearishness is a bias that has not received as much coverage as other forms of trader bias. The bearish bias in the market since 2008 is probably the costliest human bias in finance. Think of all the money lost on short ES futures in the past 10 years. (loc 3859)</p>

<p>ideally when you spot a pattern, you want to be able to ascribe some sort of logic to it. If you can’t, assume it is random unless you are studying a large sample of data or have some other reason to think the streak is not just a product of chance. (loc 3935)</p>

<p>[Linear thinking]</p>
<p>If you start the night with $100 and play a fair game (50% chance of winning, bet $1 to win $1), what are the odds you will hit +$100 before you lose your $100? Trick question! Because it’s not a trick. 50%. OK, now what are the odds you get to $100 before losing $100 in the same $1 game, but now the odds of winning each time are 49.5%? Answer 11.5%. What about if the odds in the game are 49%? Answer 1.8%. As you repeat a game with negative edge, the probability of loss is non-linear. (loc 4063)</p>

<p>When you put on a trade, list the reasons you will take it off: stop loss or take profit hit (of course). Time triggers are fine, as long as they are determined ahead of time. For example: I will reassess at 4 p.m. today (if it’s a day trade) or at 3 p.m. Friday (if it’s a multi-day trade). These are called reassessment triggers . […]</p>
<p>Once you take a position, you are a gigantic drooling bias monster. Your weaknesses are multiplied by ten when you are in a trade.

<p>I have generally been fairly flexible in my approach but I definitely have concluded that this is the optimal strategy for most traders. Increase your risk when you have a strong P&amp;L base and decrease your risk when you are near or below zero.

<p>Here is a quote from one of the great books on self-awareness: Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now. See if you can catch yourself complaining, in either speech or thought, about a situation you find yourself in, what other people do or say, your surroundings, your life situation, even the weather. To complain is always nonacceptance of what is. It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you complain, you make yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in your power. So change the situation by taking action or by speaking out if necessary or possible; leave the situation or accept it. All else is madness. (loc 1919)</p>

<p>[excerpt from Stan Druckenmiller’s famous Lost Tree Club speech] The only way to make long-term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig. The first thing I heard when I got in the business, not from my mentor, was “bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” I’m here to tell you I was a pig. And strongly believe the only way to make long-term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig. (loc 5914)</p>

<p>are you an investor or a trader? If you have 14 line items, you are a portfolio manager or an investor, but not really a trader. Do you have 14 good ideas at one time? Probably not. Do you have 7 good ideas at one time? Again, probably not. Focus on one or two strong ideas and monetize them. Concentrate your bets in the places you think you have the most edge and the highest conviction. Spreading bets around is a recipe for higher transaction costs, lazy risk management, diluted returns and correlation confusion. (loc 5951)</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>if you have a trade where you were risking 1% to make 2% and then it quickly moves 1.5% in your favor. At that point the question is, are you now risking 2.5% to make 0.5% (unattractive!) or do you ignore the mark to market and stick with your original plan. The answer is not obvious.</p>
<p>One way to deal with this is to move your stop loss higher as the trade moves deeper in the money. This is generally logical, but introduces more noise risk as a random pullback might knock you out when the trade would have been safe under the original parameters. The most effective way to trail your stop is to use a moving average that matches the trend and update your stop loss once every 12 or every 24 hours. There is no correct answer here, but my general feeling is that if you put a trade on risking 1 to make 2, you cannot take profit all the time once you make 1.4 because that means your original plan was not really true and your risk/ reward on every trade is much worse than you think it is on inception.

On the other hand, if stocks sell off because of liquidity fears (like in March 2020), expect gold to plummet right along with stocks. (loc 4170)</p>

<p>you should seriously consider your weekend positions and whether or not they are worth it. Oil can gap 10% over a weekend. USDJPY can gap 100 to 150 pips. (loc 4527)</p>

<p>in months where the US stock market is up 3% or more, GBPUSD frequently rallies into month end and then sells off in the first week of the new month. This is caused by large hedging by foreign asset managers at month end which climaxes at 4 p.m. London time on the last day of the month. (loc 5128)</p>

<p>Selling 5,000 CL (NYMEX crude oil) futures at 2:25 p.m. will generally be easier than the same trade at 2:45 p.m. That insane volume spike at 2:30 p.m. is the NYMEX close. Many participants use Trade at Settlement (TAS) orders to guarantee the closing price on their fill and the hedging of these TAS orders creates a monster volume spike in the minutes leading up to the close. If this volume is not balanced, you will sometimes see a huge move at that time. (loc 4579)</p>

<p>I knew very well by that point in my career (I started in 1995) that when there is a major economic or policy shift, positioning doesn’t matter, but for some reason I had a mental block and struggled to go with the trend. […]</p>
<p>Eventually, positioning always matters but in the early and middle stages of watershed economic and policy changes, the macro is much bigger than any concern about positions. Thing is, as USDJPY climbed from 80 to 90 to 100, I struggled massively to trade from the long side. Instead, I was playing retracements and “big levels” and trying to top tick one of the biggest economic stories of my lifetime. I still don’t have a good sense of why I could not get myself to trade the Abenomics trend successfully. (loc 2794)</p>

<p>Another important source of trade ideas is scanning for moments when your market deviates from fair value. Fair value is a slippery concept and is almost impossible to measure with certainty so when I say “fair value” I mean “loose or best estimate of fair value”. You never know what the real fair value of a market is, but you know that if oil drops $2 and copper drops 5% at the same time, fair value for the Canadian dollar has probably just gone down, not up.

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Planning and journalling</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Keep a trading journal. A trading journal is the best way to keep track of your progress, especially early in your career. It can be a detailed record of every single trade you do, or it can be a few paragraphs you write at the end of the day. A trading journal can take whatever form you like. Record a few thoughts each day, or record the specifics of each trade you do. Either way, a journal will enhance your ability to analyze performance, and improve your process. You will start to notice repeated mistakes. You will identify bias in your views. “Hmmm, I’m always short bonds and never long. That’s probably not good. I need to be more flexible.” Your journal entries should focus on your decision-making and process. What triggered the idea? How strongly did you feel about it? Was it all logic, or partly gut? Describe the specifics of the process and the route you took to develop, execute, and exit the trade. (loc 1412)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It is extremely difficult to maintain a trading journal habit but it is worth it. And just because it is difficult, that is no excuse not to do it. Very few highly-productive habits are easy to maintain. Remember that if trading was easy, it would not pay so well. (loc 1805)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There are many ways that a journal can help you. It can take two basic forms. One is a trade-by-trade journal. If you are new to trading, I recommend this approach. A free form approach is fine for more experienced traders but a more granular system will help new traders collect more data. (loc 1816)</p>

<p>Thoughts are abstract and fuzzy. Writing is concrete and solid. Often, the process of writing things down will bring out new ideas and thoughts, and will lead to different results. As Daniel Boorstin once said: “I write to discover what I think.” (loc 1838)</p>

<p>Writing a quick plan in the morning anchors you and forces you to stop and think, before you start trading. You don’t have to write anything elaborate. It can be two sentences you send to your co-worker or it can be a detailed trade plan before each and every trade. The format is not the thing, the doing it is the thing.</p>

<p>The 1956 classic “How to Lie with Statistics” by Darrell Huff does a super job of explaining the basics of how to handle statistics like this. I think every human being should read that book, even if they don’t care about statistics or finance. (loc 4008)</p>

<p>If you have never read any technical analysis books or websites, my suggestion is that you either take 10 or 15 hours to read a bunch of technical analysis websites and watch YouTube videos about techs… Or read two or three good books on technical analysis (e.g., John Murphy’s or Steve Nison’s book120). Another great resource is the 6-part Market Profile Study Guide from the CME. You can Google it and find the PDF free online. Market Profile is a bit esoteric but I find it logical and easy to understand. Your intention while reading about technical analysis is to find 2 to 5 simple indicators or patterns that you like. Use these as your primary risk management and market screening tools. Then, you can add a few more over time. (loc 5233)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Model-free options trading]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the surface, <em>Option Market Making</em> might seem like a rather antiquated book – it was written in 1992 when option trading was exclusively done by humans in pits, a far cry from modern electronic market making. But this setup lends quite a lot of pedagogical value to the book, making it a good resource for beginners, and also provides a slightly different perspective versus other options books, for those who are already somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>The book builds intuition in model-free options trading: how to reason about options without purely plugging numbers into some pricer. Baird discusses put-call parity in depth – not just the concept, but also what it means for a market maker in practice – including seldom-discussed topics like synthetic options positions. Futures options are given equal treatment to equity options, since in the model-free world they are not much harder to think about (though they do carry different risks, which Baird explains in detail).</p>
<p><em>Option Market Making</em> is a how-to guide for option market makers – a handbook of actionable wisdom, rather than a treatise on the mathematical properties of options. Baird emphasises the importance of knowing what risks you have and avoiding blowups. One gets the sense that several of these lessons were learnt the hard way! While the book could be used as a first text on options, it is probably not suitable for someone who is brand new to trading more generally because Baird implicitly assumes basic familiarity with the function of a market maker, and options are taught from the point of view of someone who has to manage an option portfolio.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[14 years! 5127 prototypes!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Against the Odds</em> is a remarkable story of adversity and grit. I don’t think I’ve come across a founder story that I would characterise as “easy”, but Dyson’s stands out as uniquely arduous. He was no stranger to tragedy; at the age of nine his father died of cancer, devastating his family – though he believes that this event encouraged him to think and behave differently from his classmates. He was a serial inventor who was serially screwed over by his business partners; prior to the famous vacuum cleaner, he invented a new type of wheelbarrow that sold very well, before his brother-in-law staged a corporate coup to wrest control of the company from him.</p>
<p>At the age of 31, inspired by seeing an industrial cyclone in a sawmill, he had a vision for a different type of vacuum cleaner. Now we get to the ridiculous part: it took him 14 years to get from this flash of insight to a perfect product. 14 years! 5127 prototypes! And even at the end of these 14 years, it’s not like money started flowing in automatically. He had to go out and sell it, which involved further patent litigation and corporate backstabbing. I really struggle to understand the self-belief required to stick at something for 14 years without getting external feedback that what you’re doing is working. 14 years!</p>
<p>There is certainly some amount of righteous bitterness in the book. Because of his bad experiences with business partners, he is a firm believer in maintaining equity control and patent protection. Because of the lack of domestic support during his product development, he is scathingly critical of the British innovation environment. Yet there is also a thoughtful maturity about the sacrifices he made: “I regret that now, in a way. I saw my own son having a whale of a time at college, going out clubbing, drinking, never seeing daylight and doing all his work at the last minute. It is perhaps the only thing that I actually regret not having conformed with”.</p>
<p>An incredible read – Dyson deserves every bit of the success he now enjoys.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Literally everyone is being exploited]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Very Important People</em> is an ecological study of the VIP nightlife industry, with a focus on the interaction between promoters, “girls”, and the wealthy men that frequent the nightclubs.</p>
<p>For me, the takeaway is that everybody in this sociological system is being exploited in one way or another. The women, many of whom work in the fashion industry, are pitched that showing up to these events will give them career advantages – meanwhile, they are obviously objectified and used as lures to bring wealthy men to clubs. The wealthy men, in turn, crave the attention and societal status achieved from being surrounded by attractive women. The promoters, who bring the women, are deluded by the belief that they are peers of the wealthy men, while in reality they are mostly excluded from the elite circles they help to maintain:</p>
<p>Mears explains the VIP nightlife system with reference to the idea of conspicuous spending (Veblen goods), and in particular, the concept of a “potlatch” – a type of Native American festival that usually involves elaborate feasts and the destruction of property. The VIP nightlife scene is a product of 21st-century capitalism, with luxury consumption and the pursuit of status driving a new desire for high-status objects and experiences. Nevertheless, it is fascinating that the conspicuous spending applies narrowly to the wealthy men paying for drinks/tables in the club – monetary transactions in any other part of the system (e.g. if promoters pay women to show up) are considered very taboo:</p>
<p>Overall, Mears gives a balanced take on the system, explaining it for what it is rather than imposing moral judgments. There are even hints of optimism, for example when Mears shares the stories of people who have played their cards right to transcend the system – though tragically it is these successes, few and far between, that inspire many others to make poor decisions. From a personal perspective, I enjoyed the book because it explains a lot of my empirical observations of nights out, such as but not limited to getting turned away at the door of several NYC nightclubs. I am grateful that I can blame the system rather than myself!</p>

<p>I joined the party circuit for the world’s “Very Important People” to understand what they do with their huge and growing pools of disposable income, and how they think about wastefully destroying their money—a phenomenon that, to outsiders, often seems ridiculous and disgusting. From 2011 to 2013, I documented a ritualized form of wealth destruction in the elite club scene, one that repeats around the world, from the Hamptons to Saint-Tropez, but one that does not come easy. It takes an incredible amount of labor to enable conspicuous leisure, and this labor upholds a gendered economy of value in which women’s bodies are assessed against men’s money. (loc 104)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>While the VIP club space extracted value from women’s beauty, women suspected of using their looks for their own economic gain were shunned. Club owners, promoters, and wealthy clients all shared suspicions around women who seemed to have economic motivations. (loc 2269)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Sexuality has always had asymmetrical consequences for men and women. Men gain status and respect with their sexual conquests, while promiscuity ruins a woman’s respectability. Girls may have abundant riches in the form of bodily capital, but their capacity to spend it is limited by gendered rules of sexual conduct. (loc 2343)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>girls had a powerful asset in the form of bodily capital that gave them access to the VIP world, but it was worth far more to men, for whom girls functioned as a valuable currency, a resource we might call girl capital. (loc 2480)</p>

<p>In the nightlife business, Dre is known as an image promoter. This means he works freelance, contracting with multiple nightclubs and restaurants throughout the city to bring in a so-called “quality crowd,” understood to consist of attractive women, rich men, celebrities, and other well-connected people. (loc 167)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Dre knew that his work was disreputable, but it was lucrative. He was making over $200,000 a year. Though his income paled in comparison to those of the rich men around him at night, he was confident that the gap would shrink. Working alongside this segment of the new global elite, he believed, would enable him to one day become one of them. (loc 177)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In essence, the promoter’s job is to stage a show of two types of power—wealth and beauty—embodied in the form of rich men and girls, respectively. (loc 374)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Promoters typically began their career as subs, making $50 per girl that they bring out, or about $100–200 per night. (loc 910)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Since every high-end club hires a handful of image promoters each night, this creates serious competition for any given promoter to find models, befriend them, and get them to come out night after night. If promoters get it wrong—if their girls are not beautiful enough or are too few in number—they’ll get reprimanded by club managers. They could even get fired. (loc 411)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Promoters were crucial to putting these dreamworlds together, and they were heavily invested in the belief that they too fully belonged in them. For all of their dreaming, promoters remain mostly shut out of the elite. (loc 749)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Promoters could mobilize their sex appeal to build ties with girls, which were then convertible into social capital among elite networks. But even with a formidable amount of ties to elites, few promoters were able to leverage the value of their networks in the ways they could see happening for the elite men around them. (loc 3991)</p>

<p>In the various earlier manifestations of New York City’s nightclub scenes—be it the discotheques in the 1970s or the legendary downtown dance clubs of the mid-1990s like Palladium or Tunnel—the rules were basically the same. After paying a cover charge, all visitors shared the same space with anyone else who had $20 in their pocket that night, and everyone jostled together to get an overpriced drink at the bar. (loc 250)</p>

<p>amid this surge of wealth, club owners began to approach their spaces like real estate. With increasing rents, operating a huge club on door and drink prices couldn’t turn a profit like it used to. The dance floor and the crowded area by the bar remained the same, open to whoever was willing to pay the cover charge and high drinks prices. But the real profits of a club now came from individual tables, which club owners started to “rent” to people with money, who would pay for the right to occupy one for a few hours. (loc 287)</p>

<p>Most clubs make the bulk of their profits from smaller and more reliable table bills, the $1,500 to $3,000 sums spent by groups of affluent tourists and businessmen—your run-of-the-mill banker, tech developer, or other upper-class professional with a disposable income. (loc 559)</p>

<p>Franz Boas, the pioneer of modern American anthropology, was among the first ethnographers to document wasting rituals, in late-nineteenth-century tribes along the Pacific Northwest Coast in what is now Canada. With his key informant George Hunt, Boas depicted competitive gifting and feasting rituals called potlatches. In a potlatch, a tribal chief or noble lavished gifts of considerable riches upon his guests to advance his title or rank, doling out large quantities of food, woolen blankets, or silver bracelets. Potlatch ceremonies often began as a feast and culminated in a fire, sometimes with the outright destruction of property, like tossing blankets into a fire, breaking canoes, or throwing heirloom coppers into the ocean. (loc 1267)</p>

<p>Potlatch is about rank. It can be playful and transgressive, but it is always rooted in systems of prestige and power. (loc 1286)</p>

<p>the VIP circuit demonstrates a historically significant moment, a form of status acquisition made possible by the conditions of twenty-first-century capitalism. (loc 4049)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Money is only a means to status. It can buy prestige through philanthropy. It can buy high-status objects like artworks and fine wines to impress visitors. Money can buy your residence in an affluent neighborhood and your children’s place in the right school. The sum total of all of these efforts creates valuable “cultural capital,” what French social theorist Pierre Bourdieu identified as the mastery of upper-class cultural codes. (loc 4082)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Economists have called the rise of luxury consumption “luxury fever,” a ratcheting upward of price-driven distinction resulting in an arms race for positional, or status-affirming goods. These dynamics drive new markets for high-status objects like artworks and fine wines, which French theorists Luc Boltanski and Arnaud Esquerre call “exceptional objects,” things that are sold by the rich to the rich and are valued mostly for the fact of their expensiveness. (loc 4103)</p>

<p>VIP clubs have to enable the potlatch to unfold in a way that suspends the deliberateness of status-seeking, primarily by making it seem spontaneous and playful. It takes an enormous amount of labor to pull off a successful potlatch performance. Like any organized social form, the potlatch is a collective ritual that unfolds in carefully scripted situations; it is constituted by a shared culture of excess and the collective valorization of waste. (loc 4121)</p>

<p>For sites designed for the display and squander of money, VIP clubs undertake elaborate efforts to conceal economic exchanges. Money is front and center in the champagne potlatch, yet it is also carefully hidden in the relations between clients, clubs, promoters, and girls. Direct monetary exchanges between these groups is taboo. For clients, clubs afford them the chance to act out domination over each other and over girls’ bodies, without the taboo that comes with hiring women directly, (loc 4190)</p>

<p>These men, all of whom could be described as “working rich,” even when they came from wealthy families, voiced clear justifications for their own large bills in clubs. They minimized their own expenditures by drawing symbolic boundaries between themselves and other clients. In the VIP arena, where vast financial resources are on display, even the biggest spenders could see their purchases as relatively modest. There is always someone spending more, given the extent to which the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of men like the whales. (loc 1607)</p>

<p>Several clients explained that this is the nature of wealth in a city like New York, where their own riches might seem paltry compared to those of someone else in the same room.

<p>Jonas and Donald had strategic goals that the right kinds of girls could help them achieve. Girls got them invited to Lou’s parties, and they opened the door for business talk—for Jonas, about yacht rentals, and for Donald, about private-equity investments. For these men, girls functioned as decor in two senses of the word: they were an embellishment that made the men look better than they were; they were also a mark of honor, a status signifier that caught the attention of other men.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Separate your beliefs and preferences]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Red-Blooded Risk</em> is ostensibly a book about financial risk management, but I think the subtitle “The Secret History of Wall Street” is a much better description. It is a tour de force – Brown commands an incredible breadth of knowledge and wanders freely between the origins of money, sports betting strategies, and finance.</p>
<p>It is this breadth of knowledge (along with his track record, of course) that lends authority to Brown’s takes on risk management. Brown highlights the importance of value-at-risk (VaR), which is a tool that several practitioners reject – he claims that this is because most people use it wrong. VaR is not a risk <em>metric</em> , rather, it defines a boundary that separates two regions: the well-behaved region where statistics can be collected, then the trans-VaR region which requires a different set of tools to understand (mostly centred around scenario analysis).</p>
<p>This naturally flows into a discussion of bet sizing, which is made all the more credible by Brown’s history as a poker player and sports bettor. The book has a good exposition of Kelly betting, in particular, how it contrasts philosophically against Markowitz-style portfolio optimisation: Kelly betting diversifies across time, while MPT diversifies across assets at each moment in time. Brown pitches that it is the discovery of Kelly betting that gave rise to the modern hedge fund industry – such is the power of the exponential growth (”risk ignition”) that can arise with proper bet sizing and positive edge.</p>
<p>The most surprising thread in the book, and probably the one that I will be mulling on most going forward, is Brown’s history of money. Money is not something I truly claim to understand, which is probably for the best given that Brown believes most of the classic understandings are wrong. For example, he points out that money does not actually require a central bank, it’s just that most governments have decided to monopolise money creation – this money is backed by the confidence that one can pay taxes with it. Things start to get wacky when Brown argues that derivative instruments like futures are also a form of money… something I will need to revisit.</p>
<p><em>Red-Blooded Risk</em> can sometimes be a confusing book to read, given the many interwoven strands and the embedded graphic novel. It has taken me many weekend afternoons to digest some of my highlights from the book, but given the range of topics discussed and the depth of Brown’s perspectives, I am hopeful that it was time well spent.</p>

<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Risk as opposed to dangers/opportunities:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“Risks are two-sided; you can win or you can lose. Dangers and opportunities are one-sided”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dangers and opportunities are often harder to measure</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dangers and opportunities are often “exogenous”, coming from nature. Risks are a result of human interactions and we can often choose to control the level.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Types of people:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Thin-blooded (cowards): treat risks as dangers</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Hot-blooded (thrill-seekers): treat risks as opportunities</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Cold-blooded: treats dangers and opportunities as risks</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Red-blooded; excited by challenges, but not blinded by dangers and opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Three rules of risk taking:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Only make +EV bets</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Try to make your bets independent</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Size bets properly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Separation of beliefs and preferences: improve decision-making by separating into probability distributions and utility functions.<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Market-implied distributions don’t purely measure probability, they incorporate utility.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">e.g. we know people overpay for insurance, so the risk-neutral probability of a large loss will be higher than the real probability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Numeraire: a unit of account (doesn’t have to be a medium of exchange or store of value)<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">No perfect numeraire: define probabilities for the 95-99% of scenarios, but be aware of the 1% “var breaks”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“Intelligent risk management has to begin with a numeraire, plus the awareness that the numeraire does not cover all possible outcomes of the decision.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Seven principles of risk management:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Risk duality: split analysis into “normal” times where we have enough data to make comments, then VaR breaks whose probabilities can’t be estimated.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Valuable Boundary: VaR boundaries are hard to estimate</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Risk Ignition: optimal bet sizing (Kelly) can lead to exponential success.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Money: allows constraints and objectives to be measured in the same quantity</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Evolution: random variation can be beneficial because it creates antifragility</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Superposition: duplication can be long-term beneficial even if it seems short-term inefficient</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Game theory: coin-flip randomness is different to game-theory randomness. It requires you to consider how your bet influences other risk-takers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">What is VaR:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">VaR models should be backtested and forward tested: there should be breaks 5% of the time.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">VaR breaks should be independent in time and independent of VaR level.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">VaR is not a measure of risk: it only defines the region where we have good data</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">VaR breaks are important signals that something has changed.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“The general risk management principle is to define ahead of time the set of outcomes for which you have confidence in probability estimates (usually because you have plenty of data, but possibly because you trust a theory) and, crucially, how often you will get an outcome outside that set”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">General risk management process for traders:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Estimate a 95% 1-day VaR each day before trading. This can start with a historical VaR but needs to be augmented</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">This VaR needs to be backtested</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Collect data on both sides of the VaR barrier. For the trans-VaR region, supplement with scenario analysis</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Determine the optimal Kelly bet based on the data within the VaR limit and trans-VaR scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Investment growth theory:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Kelly optimal portfolios: diversification is good because it tends to lead to more appropriate bet sizing, not because the risks offset.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Kelly betting is about diversifying through time; Markowitz is about diversifying cross-sectionally</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Because Kelly depends on variance rather than stdev, it is inherently multi-period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Tulip mania: almost all of the commentary on Tulip mania derives from Mackay’s <em>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</em> , which is historically inaccurate<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">People were paying for the rights to tulip varieties, not individual flowers</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The current inflation-adjusted price of tulips is higher than it was in 1610</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“Every test of market efficiency is a joint test of market efficiency and market equilibrium”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Inefficiency: assets are mispriced, but you can trade at the current price</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Disequilibrium: either transactions are not taking place, or they are being forced to take place away from known fair value (e.g. huge flow coming in)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">e.g. dual class share arbitrage:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Frequentists treat this as an inefficiency, are happy to be long cheap short rich, collecting margin interest</li>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Derivative money – futures as financing tools:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">In reality, a wheat farmer will not sell wheat futures to lock in a price – they will just go to a miller and arrange a direct contract.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">But the miller (who is buying wheat from the farmer) may <em>sell</em> wheat futures. This is equivalent to borrowing wheat (owning it now, having to deliver in future)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The miller can then roll their short futures position, never needing to deliver wheat.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Similar to a cash loan that you intend to keep refinancing. The mark-to-market payments are the analogue of interest. Using futures to hedge is analogous to selling stocks for cash as a hedge.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">This means every commodity has its own “interest rate” (the shape of the forward curve).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Futures spreads trades can be thought of as financing arrangements:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Buy March Chicago wheat sell March Kansas wheat: you are lending transport from Chicago to Kansas (assuming Kansas price higher)</li>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Defining risk</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Risk is something you dial up or down in order to accomplish a goal. It is neither good nor bad in itself. This is the sense in which I always use the word risk in this book. Compare this to the “risk” of a basketball player getting injured. I will use the word danger for this, not risk. Dangers should be minimized, subject to constraints. For example, we don’t want to require so much protective padding that a game is not fun, or the cost is too great. So we don’t try to set danger of injury to zero, but we also don’t “manage” it; we never increase it for its own sake.</p>
<p>The counterpart to a danger on the good side is an “opportunity,” such as the opportunity for a pitcher in baseball to get a no-hitter. This is considered so valuable that a manager will almost always leave a pitcher with a chance at a no-hitter in the game, even if he is tiring and a relief pitcher would increase the probability of winning the game. (loc 257)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Frank Knight, for example, made a distinction between risk, with known probabilities and outcomes, and uncertainty, which is something akin to our dangers and opportunities. But he did this to emphasize the limits of mathematics in decision making under uncertainty. He did not appreciate the power of quantitative methods for separating risk from uncertainty, nor the tremendous benefit from applying mathematics to optimize risk taking. (loc 315)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When economists consider risk, they usually assume that the types of stakes don’t matter—gambling for money is no different from gambling for anything else of value. That turns out not to be true. Optimizing requires goals and constraints. Optimizing risk requires that the two be interchangeable. One way that can happen is if both are measured in money. It also turns out that any time you set up a risk-taking activity with the same units used for goals and constraints, you create a form of money. (loc 401)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Suppose I observe that you will bet one apple against one orange on some event. I don’t know what probability you assign to the event, because I can’t divide apples by oranges. But then suppose I see you trade one apple for two oranges. Now I know you were giving two to one odds, meaning you think the event has at least two chances in three of occurring. I have separated your decisions into preferences—how much you like apples versus oranges—and beliefs—how likely you think the event is. This is the basic separation required for the modern idea of rationality, the assumption underlying most modern economic utility theory. It depends crucially on both gambling and exchange—on randomness and money. (loc 473)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>However, there are many different distributions and utility functions that are equally good at explaining brain activity and behavior for individual decisions, and no distribution and utility function that explains all decisions, even for one individual at one time. Intelligent risk management has to begin with a numeraire, plus the awareness that the numeraire does not cover all possible outcomes of the decision. (loc 484)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In textbooks, you can then arrange all the little risks in carefully calibrated sizes in an optimal order to maximize your expected utility. In reality, with real risk, you have to make a series of decisions without knowing exactly what the future risks will be, what all the possible outcomes are, what the probability of winning is, or how you’ll feel about things after the results are in. (loc 1930)</p>

<p>I describe myself as a “quant” with a lowercase q, unpretentious as in, “just a simple quant.” I’m not humble, as you’ll figure out if you keep reading, but I’m not given to overstatement. What I do isn’t rocket science, most of it is trivially simple and the rest is more meticulous care than brilliance. But to be historically accurate, we’re stuck with the term, and it does convey some of the spirit of the group. We contrasted ourselves to people we called “Einsteins,” an even stupider name. We had nothing against Albert Einstein, but we disagreed with people who thought risk was deeply complex and could be figured out by pure brainpower, without actually taking any risk or observing any risk takers. “Einstein” was rarely used as a noun. It was more common as an adjective. “He had a good insight, but went Einstein with it,” (loc 328)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The only way you got VaR accepted on the trading floor in the early 1990s was to bet; you can imagine what traders think of a risk manager who tells them how to run their billion-dollar portfolios but won’t risk $10,000 of his own money on his analysis. (loc 730)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The problem is that the field of probability was not discovered; rather, it was created by the confusion of two concepts. The first is the frequency with which certain events recur, such as the number of times out of 100 throws a coin will come up heads. The second is the degree of belief to attach to a proposition, such as how likely it is that France will win the next World Cup.</p>
<p>the effort to make statistics fully rigorous was completed only around 1960. Until then, the natural thought was that when we got to the bottom of things, the relationship between frequency and belief would become obvious. Instead, we had fully consistent theories of both, with no significant overlap, and no paths for further inquiry. (loc 1212)</p>

<p>Risk was a fusion of observed frequencies and belief formation, and both the observation and the psychology were a lot more complex than most people realized. They required new empirical work to understand them. (loc 1217)</p>

<p>One camp gravitated toward blackjack card counting and other advantage gambling (playing standard casino games in a way that the odds favor the player instead of the house). These people are frequentists. Advantage gamblers were apt to sneer at the rest of us, calling us hustlers who conned people.</p>
<p>Another group diverged in the opposite direction. The invention of the point spread and the unrestrained growth of organized crime had turned sports betting from the domain of local bookies, who took risk but might lay off a large imbalance through an informal network, to a highly organized, mostly illegal, national business that was allergic to risk. It was easy for quants to identify profitable bet opportunities in this system, because the spreads were set to equalize money bet on both sides, not to reflect the true probability of winning.</p>
<p>These guys were Bayesians, degree-of-belief believers. A sporting event cannot be repeated. The line will be set by the public’s beliefs about the outcome or, more precisely, by the organization’s and insiders’ predictions about the public’s beliefs. (loc 1292)</p>

<p>From a frequentist point of view, suppose someone tells you he rejects the hypothesis that it will snow in New York City tomorrow at the 5 percent level. He can say this every day with perfect accuracy, since it snows in New York City on fewer than 5 percent of days. But the statement is useless for practical decision making. Some days have essentially zero chance of snow; on other days snow is virtually certain. (loc 512)</p>

<p>When a frequentist rejects a hypothesis at the 5 percent level, that does not mean the negation of the hypothesis has a 95 percent chance of being true. It’s possible to have a set of mutually exclusive hypotheses, all of which can be individually rejected at the 5 percent level. (loc 558)</p>

<p>we rejected the idea of a fully defined probability distribution that covered all possible future events.

<p>we can use market observation of underlying stock and option prices to estimate the risk-neutral distribution of underlying stock returns, and price any derivative at its expected value under the risk-neutral distribution. The risk-neutral distribution is distinct from the actual probability distribution. For one example, we know investors pay more for returns in bad states of the world than in good states. This means the risk-neutral probability distribution has higher probability values on market crashes than their actual chance of occurring. (loc 5590)</p>

<p>most quantitative people focus on the house edge, the fraction of each dollar bet the casino gets on average. But a casino cares about something different: the hold, the fraction of chips customers buy that the casino ends up winning. The hold depends on the edge, of course, but also on betting speed and bettor behavior. Casinos offer games with wide variation of edge, but strikingly similar holds (with some adjustment for the cost of offering the game). (loc 765)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>The Seven Principles of Risk Management </strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p><strong>Principle I: Risk Duality</strong></p>
<p>The first principle of modern quantitative risk management is to split the analysis into two parts. For normal, common events you have plenty of data to make reliable quantitative conclusions using historical statistics. But long-term success requires at least surviving the abnormal, unexpected, uncommon events you know will also occur. The greatest long-term success requires exploiting—not just surviving—them. So you need to take them into account as well. You must manage them even though you don’t know what might happen, you don’t know how your actions will influence what might happen, and you certainly can’t assign probabilities. (loc 687)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>**Principle II: Valuable Boundary **</p>
<p>The next principle to be discovered was a complete surprise. We had assumed it would be pretty easy to define the region in which you had plenty of data—in other words, how much things could vary and still be considered normal. After all, you have plenty of data there, by definition.</p>
<p>Setting VaR seems like a reasonably easy statistics problem, but it’s not. You have to quote the number every day before trading begins, even when there are data problems, and VaR is never adjusted later. (loc 724)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One major result is we learned how little we had understood about the risk in the well-behaved center of the probability distribution on normal trading days. We had thought all our risk problems were in the tails of the distribution or on abnormal days. There was another surprise, pleasant rather than unpleasant. It turned out that changes in portfolio VaR, once you got a good VaR system, were extremely useful information for both making money and managing risk. VaR breaks were equally useful, as signals that something had changed. (loc 732)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The general risk management principle is to define ahead of time the set of outcomes for which you have confidence in probability estimates (usually because you have plenty of data, but possibly because you trust a theory) and, crucially, how often you will get an outcome outside that set. The effort to create this system will teach you a lot; especially it will teach you how little you knew before making the attempt to predict and validating that attempt rigorously. In my experience, any change in the set boundary will prove to be a useful input to decisions. When you get an outcome outside the set, it will be a useful alert that something is changing. (loc 748)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The secret to managing risk outside the VaR boundary is to make sure it is good risk, and to set up the right structure of decision making. That means we have to jettison utility theory, at least in its simplest form, because it teaches that all risk is bad. (loc 942)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>**Principle III: Risk Ignition **</p>
<p>The third principle of modern quantitative risk management was an antisurprise, which we called “risk ignition.” This is an idea that traces back to John Kelly—who we met briefly in Chapter 1—in 1956. He discovered that if you take an optimal amount of risk—not more and not less—you can be certain of exponentially growing success, which will always leave you better off than any other strategy. Instead of gains and losses bobbing you up and down, you can take off like a rocket to astronomical success. (loc 753)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>quants had been trying to ignite risk for years, and it always seemed to fail. Only when we learned to set a VaR limit and make provisions for events outside it could strategies survive long enough to benefit from ignition. Before this discovery, hedge funds had been around since 1949. Most of them had failed, but the successful ones had made their owners moderately wealthy. Suddenly we got a slew of hedge fund billionaires, and we produced a few new ones every year since. (loc 804)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p><strong>Principle IV: Money</strong> In conventional analysis of risk, you can gamble for any stakes, monetary or nonmonetary. The study of risk is unrelated to the study of money. But as we saw in Chapter 1, the two are intimately linked. You can’t ignite risk without money and you can’t understand money without understanding risk. (loc 812)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p><strong>Principle V: Evolution</strong> What are some examples of good risk? Evolution, for one. Random variation leads to more wonderful creations than anything any human ever designed on purpose. (loc 945)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Conventional economic reasoning says that if two stocks have similar expected future cash flows and similar dependence on the market, we prefer the one that is less volatile. But might we not see some advantage to stock in volatile company A, which has survived many crises, over stock in safe, untested company B? Perhaps A’s stresses have allowed evolution of the characteristics that will succeed in the future, whereas B is narrowly positioned for the conditions of the past. (loc 980)</p>

<p><strong>Principle VI: Superposition</strong></p>
<p>If everything is priced in money, marked to market and subject to liquid trading, you get a narrowly efficient result. Because the result is highly specialized to a set of prices and uniform throughout the economy, even a small change in prices can cause a large dislocation. In a less integrated and controlled economy, lots of innovation will be sparked by people encountering overlooked and underpriced assets, and by other people facing unusual price structures. A lot of this activity will represent waste, but it does mean that when prices change there will be economic players positioned to take advantage</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>**Principle VII: Game Theory **</p>
<p>a legislator or judge can do a better job if she deals only with general principles without knowing in advance the precise effects of laws or decisions. That is why justice is blind: she hears only the facts of the case; she does not see anything else to make her prefer plaintiff or defendant. Her decision is to be based on principles, not predictions of effects. (loc 1052)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Game theory should influence thinking about risk in a different way than evolution and quantum physics did. Game theory reverses the causality. Instead of risk arising in nature and analysts trying to make predictions in spite of it, risk is something deliberately created by people or implicitly created by social systems for useful purposes. It’s the difference between lightning and the electricity that comes through a wire to light your home. They obey the same physical laws, but for most practical purposes are unrelated phenomena. (loc 1060)</p>

<p>A financial example of the fallacy of confusing game theory randomness with coin flip randomness is Black Wednesday. Instead of treating the exchange rate as a random walk, the British Treasury should have considered it as a bet. In order to win the contest, it had to be able to create a credible scenario in which speculators would have been hurt if they had failed. In the circumstances that may not have been possible, in which case the Treasury could have saved a lot of money and pride by bowing to the inevitable. (loc 1089)</p>

<p>For Harry, the key was diversification. You didn’t put all your money in one stock because you should use money to buy lots of other stocks. For Kelly, the key was bet sizing. You shouldn’t put all your money in one stock because it is overbetting. It didn’t matter whether there were other stocks to invest in or not. Harry said not to put all your money in one stock because there are simultaneous investment opportunities. Kelly said not to put all your money in one stock because there are future betting opportunities. (loc 1494)</p>

<p>In the real world, Markowitz created modern portfolio theory (MPT). It holds that investors care about the statistical properties of their portfolios and act to maximize expected return subject to a risk constraint. Expected return is good, risk is bad, and the investor balances the two. A Kelly-inspired analogue might have been called investment growth theory (IGT). The claim would be that investors select a portfolio for optimal long-term growth. Investors care about investments, not portfolios, and determine how much to allocate to each based on expected return and variance. There are portfolio effects; your capital allocation decision on each investment depends on your past decisions, but these are pretty small in practice unless you are considering highly correlated assets. In the IGT world, we would expect an investor to analyze investment opportunities one at a time. Each acceptable investment would be assigned an investment amount, a lot for the most attractive and lowest-risk opportunities, less for either marginally attractive or high-risk opportunities, (loc 1631)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>IGT is bottom-up. An investor considers investments, makes an allocation decision, and then moves on to the next decision. The portfolio is what results from this process. (loc 1650)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>IGT also seems to be a better description of investor thought processes. Investors focus on how much capital is at risk in a position, what the expected return is, and how much variance of return can be expected. These are the three most important parameters in Kelly investing. MPT suggested that the most important question was correlation among investments, which was pretty far down on an investor’s list of concerns—at least it was before Harry. (loc 1656)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Harry also said that standard deviation mattered, not variance. Although the two might seem to be the same (standard deviation is the square root of variance), they differ in one key respect. In order to compare standard deviation to expected return, you have to specify a time horizon, whereas variance and expected return have the same ratio at any time horizon. MPT is a one-period theory; you pick the best portfolio, and then at the end of the period you trade it in for the portfolio optimized for the next period. IGT is a dynamic theory without a fixed time horizon; (loc 1659)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The IGT CAPM is here to demonstrate that the MPT CAPM can become a rut that prevents its students from seeing that there are rational, even reasonable, alternatives to the MPT CAPM worldview. (loc 1703)</p>

<p>Money is even less important in abnormal times. If you are thirsty in a desert, the price of water does not have much meaning. If there is a financial liquidity crisis, the money value of your levered investment is equally irrelevant. (loc 825)</p>

<p>Also, money captures the value of any degree of success. We will see later that those are precisely the two things that make risk ignition possible. We’ll also see that those two things are essential for the creation of true money, defined as a single instrument that simultaneously functions as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a numeraire or standard of value.

<p>Paper money is created by some institution that we will call a “bank.” This institution does not need reserves of gold and silver. It does need to make loans. It does not lend precious metal; it lends pieces of paper. The borrowers exchange those pieces of paper for goods and services for their business. Then they sell the products of their business for paper, and use that to repay the loan with interest. The use of physical paper is not important; it is merely a record-keeping device.</p>
<p>There is an obvious vulnerability to the system: what if people lose confidence in the paper money? That can happen for a number of reasons. For example, people could notice borrowers having trouble repaying their loans; demand for money in general could decline; or another institution could fail, causing a panic. Sometimes it happens for no reason at all. The bank can try to reassure the public. It can hold a lot of reserve capital to cover losses; it can make only sound, short-term loans on liquid collateral; it can offer to sell gold and silver for its paper money. But these are optional reassurances only; none are fundamental economic functions of a money creator. (loc 2521)</p>

<p>The biggest misunderstanding about paper money is the idea that it is a promise for gold or silver, and that it serves the same function as precious metal coins. It’s an entirely different thing. Rules requiring it to relate to gold and silver are passed in order to destroy true paper money, to turn it into a mere token or a convenient substitute when precious metal is in short supply.

<p>Each type of paper money has its own interest rate, which is measured by both the interest the bank pays on deposits (if any) and the discount at which the money is accepted (if any). This is a new type of price signal, absent from precious metal. Also, there are exchange rates for different paper monies, another important new signal. (loc 2576)</p>

<p>Someone would decide he wanted to build or buy a power plant. He wouldn’t go to a bank or venture capital fund for the money; he’d go to a derivatives dealer. Our entrepreneur would enter into a contract to receive 10 years of oil supplies to power the plant, plus another contract to sell 10 years of electricity generated by the plant—when these two swaps are combined they are called a “tolling” swap. Since the value of the electricity exceeds the value of oil, he receives cash up front. He uses the cash to buy or build the plant, and to pay other bills like wages and maintenance. At the end of the 10 years, he owns the plant free and clear, his reward for putting the deal together and overseeing successful operation for a decade. If he has failed to operate the plant successfully, he wouldn’t be able to deliver the promised electricity, and the plant would be seized by his derivatives counterparty. You might object that there is cash involved in this deal: cash to buy the plant, cash to pay wages, and other expenses. But this is more of an accounting entry than real cash. The deal is structured so cash is spent as soon as it becomes available. Cash plays no essential part in the business or its financing. (loc 3331)</p>

<p>the fundamental value is that the money can be used to pay taxes. Just as a government can issue revenue-anticipation bonds to be repaid when taxes come in, it can spend paper money that will have value because people need it to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Despite the large amount of currency held for transactional reasons and to store value, the basic tax value is still important. If faith in the ability or willingness of the government to raise enough taxes to cover its expenditures and debt erodes, the money will be accepted only at a discount, which we call inflation.

<p>A crucial point in interpreting tests of efficient markets theory was described by Eugene Fama, known as the father of efficient markets: “Every test of market efficiency is a joint test of market efficiency and market equilibrium.” (loc 2932)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It was the frequentists, the blackjack card counters, who adopted the idea that markets are inefficient, but always in equilibrium. Prices can be wrong in an economic sense, too high or too low, but you can buy or sell as much as you want at the posted price. In that case, you make money by computing the correct price for securities. You don’t worry who is on the other side of the transaction. You’re transacting with some abstract thing called the “market,” just as an advantage gambler is playing against the “house,”</p>
<p>Your job is to teach the market, not to learn from it. Although you profit from market inefficiency, you hate it. That’s a deep emotional response. You don’t want to live in a universe of messy error; you want to live in one of clean, perfect mathematical beauty. Since you don’t, all you can do is try to create a more perfect universe. In addition, you have the practical consideration that when the market gets more inefficient you lose money, and when it gets more efficient you make money. (loc 2946)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The card counters have faith in the market, and fear the actions of people. The sports bettors are relying on the predictable actions of people to move the spread a certain way, and fear the market forces that might disrupt historical patterns. (loc 3023)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There’s no practical way to know which pieces have been fully incorporated into the price, and which ones have not. However, on a statistical basis, it’s usually a good bet that the average bit of news has not been fully incorporated. Therefore, if the net direction of the crack spread over the last month has been up, there has been more good news than bad, so it’s more likely than not that there is net positive information—information that should push the price up—not yet incorporated into the price. (loc 3055)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>You don’t need a Sharpe ratio near or at 1 to get rich. For a Kelly investor, the long-term growth of capital above the risk-free rate is approximately equal to the Sharpe ratio squared (loc 3150)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The sports-betting types preferred the low Sharpe ratio strategies. They would have liked higher Sharpes, of course, but by accepting low Sharpes they could find plenty of opportunities with other desirable characteristics. They could use simple strategies with liquid securities, for which there was constant large capacity for bets. They could have more strategies, and each strategy could bet more frequently, and each strategy could be individually more amenable to risk management. This kind of investing is what some people now call “quant,” (loc 3178)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The trouble is that combining lots of low Sharpe ratio strategies gives you a high Sharpe ratio strategy, at least if the strategy results are not highly correlated with each other. While you are not risking much of your capital on any one bet, if a lot of bets go against you at once, you’re in trouble just like an overbetting high Sharpe ratio investor. (loc 3183)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The other problem is that these strategies require cooperation of many people. The growth rate is slow and the capacity is large, so it makes sense to raise outside money and take a fee rather than investing your own money. The strategies require a lot of leverage, and dealing in large size with major brokers. In these circumstances, your fate is not entirely in your hands. You may have to cut positions at the wrong time, or even close up business entirely, (loc 3189)</p>

<p>In the end, none of it made any difference. All of us were wiped out on October 19, 1987. That was the day the stock market fell nearly 25 percent, (loc 3198)</p>

<p>The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) issued securities backed by 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages issued under Veterans Administration or Federal Housing Authority programs. These were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which in those days was considered as low-risk as you could get. These securities paid significantly higher interest rates than government Treasury bonds. Part of the reason for the additional yield spread was that Treasury bonds are redeemed at a fixed, known maturity. GNMAs were redeemed as homeowners repaid their mortgages (or defaulted on them, in which case the security holder was paid from proceeds of the foreclosure sale or by the government). Mortgages paid off on average in about seven years, one way or the other. Some people pay off their mortgages early because times are good, but most of the repayments occur when someone moves or refinances a home. The problem for the security holder was not just uncertainty. There was adverse selection. If interest rates went down, lots of people would refinance at the lower rates, and the security holders would get back money they had to reinvest at the new lower rates. (loc 3078)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Prepayment risk was much too small to justify the yield difference. It was possible to trade GNMAs actively, along with bond futures and options, to lock in highly predictable profits. (loc 3088)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One of the things I was doing at the time was running such an active GNMA portfolio. But along with a lot of other people, I saw that the real opportunity was to issue securities that mimicked the strategy. (loc 3094)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Suppose instead you could divide the cash flows from the GNMAs in a clever way to back a number of different securities with limited prepayment risk. Some investors like certainty, and would accept a yield a few basis points above Treasuries to get highly predictable cash flows. Some of them want the cash flows soon, whereas others want the money put to work for longer periods of time. Other investors don’t care when they get their money back as long as they make a good return. It was possible to set up rules for distributing cash that kept all these people happy. You made the same 4 percent per year, but you could keep 80 percent instead of 20 percent. (loc 3099)</p>

<p>Salomon Brothers issued the first collateralized mortgage obligation, as these new securities were called, and was the largest issuer for many years. (loc 3113)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Salomon Brothers divided the cash flows in time sequence, sending the early cash flows to one security; when that was paid off, cash flowed to the next security in line, and so forth. My first design gave only scheduled principal and interest to the early-maturity tranches, and sent all prepayments to the longest-maturity tranche. I still maintain this was a much better design and should have dominated the market. (loc 3116)</p>

<p>the most momentous decision, which seemed innocuous at the time, was to promise banks capital relief for spending all the money to create Basel II systems. It was clear from the start that only the most sophisticated banks would be able to compute Basel II capital, so simpler options were offered for other banks. The “advanced approach” banks had to be rewarded to give them an incentive to make the investment, and the obvious reward was lower capital requirements. After all, if they managed risk better, they should be allowed to hold less capital. This deal was never written down, as far as I know, but it was accepted as a working agreement by everyone involved in the project. (loc 6025)</p>

<p>When quants like me got into this game, we naturally did one more thing. We kept very careful records of everyone’s bets. We figured out whether people were betting the right size. It turned out that even the best traders were bad at that. They bet more when they were wrong than when they were right. (loc 3820)</p>

<p>In practice, it very often seems to be true that the two are not closely related. The trader can pick a performance ratio, the market gives the accuracy ratio. Attempting to increase the accuracy ratio by sacrificing performance ratio seldom works. Therefore, the usual advice is to target a specific performance ratio, adjusting your trading if necessary to get to that target, but only to monitor accuracy ratio. When accuracy ratio is high, bet bigger, when it’s low, bet smaller or even stop trading until the market improves for your strategy. (loc 3877)</p>

<p>Given that humans demonstrably cannot manage simple virtual systems with complete information and power, plus lots of training and practice, you would have to be a complete idiot to expect them to manage complex real systems with noisy and out-of-date information and strictly limited power, and with no training or practice.

<p>I was always midway between the frequentist and Bayesian camps. People who think like me call ourselves data analysts, and we like nonparametric or distribution-free methods. We use a lot of rough tools, like jackknifes, bootstraps, cross-tabulations, and visualizations. We like to let the data speak to us instead of trying to fit it in a preconceived model, and we like simple methods that do not require strong assumptions about either the distribution generating the data or our prior knowledge. (loc 4511)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Heteroskedasticity is easily confused with fat tails, or occasional extreme observations. With pure fat tails, the extreme days of the market would be distributed randomly in time, and returns could still be independent. With heteroskedasticity, the extreme moves would be clustered together in time. Financial data showed a bit of both, but a lot more heteroskedasticity than fat tails. (loc 4530)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>VaR breaks were another valuable warning. In fact, it’s impossible to lose a lot of money quickly unless either VaR goes up or there is a VaR break. (loc 4685)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The third problem with this [historical] VaR estimate that is caused by heteroskedasticity is that the average VaR on break days is $24,100 versus an average VaR on all days of $26,500. That’s because your VaR breaks occur disproportionately after calm periods than after volatile ones. (loc 4746)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Take any simple VaR estimate, including either of the two just mentioned. If you get a VaR break, double your VaR estimate for the next day. Call that using a VaR scaling factor of 100 percent, since you’re increasing your VaR estimate by 100 percent. Every day you have a VaR break, add one to your VaR scaling factor. Every day you don’t have a VaR break, multiply your VaR scaling factor by 0.94. You might object that that’s adding two more parameters to the VaR algorithm—the increase in scaling factor on break days and the decrease in scaling factors on nonbreak days. That’s true, but I didn’t data mine to find perfect parameters. I just doubled on break days, and I used the RiskMetrics decay factor for nonbreak days. Any reasonable set of parameters works about equally well. The important thing is that you need a VaR estimate that reacts violently to any unusual event, and settles down moderately quickly afterward. (loc 4801)</p>
<p><em>This method accounts for vol clustering (you add to your VaR estimate increasingly).</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Most VaR breaks are ordinary days, just with bigger losses. But something like one out of 10 of them are extraordinary events: regime changes, Black Swans, crises, crashes, panics, whatever. (loc 4846)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A proper middle-office risk management stress test does not postulate a situation and compute the loss; it starts from a level of loss and asks what kinds of events could cause it. The loss level is typically set at three to 10 times the VaR amount. (loc 4854)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Stress testing and scenario analysis concentrate on dramatic external events that could harm the firm. But most large losses occur instead from unexpected combinations of events that are not individually unlikely. (loc 4968)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Sometimes outliers are data errors or rare exceptions of minor interest. Sometimes they are far more important than variation within normal data. But it is almost never fruitful to combine outliers and ordinary observations in a single analysis. (loc 5755)</p>

<p>For financial trading applications, the standard process is:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Estimate a 95 percent one-day value at risk each day before trading begins. You estimate every trading day, even if systems are down or data are missing.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Compare actual daily profit and loss (P&amp;L) against the VaR prediction when the daily P&amp;L becomes available. Test for the correct number of VaR breaks, within statistical error. Test that the breaks are independent in time and independent of the level of VaR.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Once you have a reliable VaR system, collect data within the VaR limit. Investigate days when you lose more than the VaR amount, but supplement the observations with hypothetical scenarios and days in the past when your current positions would have suffered large losses.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">On the basis of the previous point’s analysis, estimate a left tail of the distribution—that is, the distribution of rare big losses. A power law fit is often appropriate. Don’t try to go to the worst possible case; accept a nonzero chance of catastrophic failure. Also on the basis of trans-VaR scenarios, consider risk factors not measured in the P&amp;L. These include leverage risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, model risk, fraud risk, and others.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Try to determine the optimal Kelly bet based on the good data you have within the VaR limit, plus the hypothetical left tail you created.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Try to get up to this level of risk while staying under the levels of leverage, liquidity, counterparty credit, and other risks that could destroy the firm in the identified trans-VaR scenarios. Again, you are not trying for zero probability of failure. (loc 5761)</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster</em> is a book with a simple message. We emit 51 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalents a year. There is ample evidence that this causes temperatures to increase, which could have catastrophic consequences. Therefore we need to make a dent in this 51 billion tonnes, somehow! It is not an alarmist take. Rather, it is the calm and rational journey of an intelligent man with significant financial means trying to understand how we can solve one of the biggest problems of our time.</p>
<p>Unlike some other climate commentators, Gates has a very humanist approach, emphasising human progress first and climate second. For instance, he generally doesn’t advocate for a reduction in industrial production (and consumption), especially in less developed countries, because they should also have the chance to develop and elevate their quality of life. This only amplifies the challenge: how do we avoid a climate disaster, while continuing the long-term upward drift of human progress?</p>
<p>Yes, the book is sometimes repetitive, excessively anecdotal in places, and is heavily inspired by other resources (like Mackay’s <em>Sustainable Energy</em> ). But as an introduction to the topic and a call to action, it is second to none.</p>

<p>Then, in 2007, Congress set out to use biofuels to solve a different problem. Now the concern wasn’t just rising oil prices; it was climate change too. The government raised the biofuels targets and in addition required that about 60 percent of all the biofuels sold in the United States be made not from corn but from other starches. (Biofuels made in this way reduce emissions three times more than conventional biofuels.) (loc 3013)</p>

<p>a big reason is that the companies that might produce these biofuels, and the investors who might back them, haven’t had any certainty about the market. The executive branch has expected shortfalls in the supply of advanced biofuels, so it keeps lowering the targets. In 2017, the target was dropped from 5.5 billion gallons to 311 million gallons. And sometimes the new targets are announced so late in the year that producers don’t know how much they can count on selling. It’s a vicious cycle: The government lowers the quota because it expects a shortfall, and the shortfalls keep happening because the government keeps lowering the quota. (loc 3018)</p>

<p>Isn’t 2030 a stop on the way to 2050? Not necessarily. Making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might actually prevent us from ever getting to zero. Why? Because the things we’d do to get small reductions by 2030 are radically different from the things we’d do to get to zero by 2050. They’re really two different pathways, (loc 3081)</p>

<p>I’ve divided the different elements of my plan into two categories. These categories will sound familiar if you’ve taken Economics 101: One involves expanding the supply of innovations—the number of new ideas that get tested—and the other involves accelerating the demand for innovations. The two work hand in hand, in a push-and-pull fashion. Without demand for innovation, inventors and policy makers won’t have any incentive to push out new ideas; without a steady supply of innovations, buyers won’t have the green products the world needs to get to zero. (loc 3116)</p>

<p>Government policies should be technology neutral (benefiting any solutions that reduce emissions, rather than a few favored ones), predictable (as opposed to regularly expiring and then getting extended, as happens frequently now), and flexible (so that many different companies and investors can take advantage of them, not just those with large federal tax bills). (loc 3230)</p>

<p>There are markets worth billions of dollars waiting for someone to invent low-cost, zero-carbon cement or steel, or a net-zero liquid fuel. As I’ve tried to show, making these breakthroughs and getting them to scale will be hard, but the opportunities are so big that it’s worth getting out in front of the rest of the world. Someone will invent these technologies. It’s just a question of who and how soon. (loc 3411)</p>

<p>The late David MacKay of Cambridge University inspired me with his wit and insights. I recommend his phenomenal book Sustainable Energy—Without the Hot Air to anyone who wants to dig deeper into the subject of energy and climate change. Vaclav Smil, a professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba, is one of the finest systems thinkers I have ever met. His influence on this book is particularly evident in the passages on the history of energy transitions, and in the errors he helped me avoid. (loc 3619)</p>

<p>Molecule for molecule, many of these other gases cause more warming than carbon dioxide does—in the case of methane, 120 times more warming the moment it reaches the atmosphere. But methane doesn’t stay around as long as carbon dioxide. (loc 326)</p>

<p>We use carbon dioxide equivalents to account for the fact that some gases trap more heat than carbon dioxide but don’t stay around as long. Unfortunately, carbon dioxide equivalents are an imperfect measure: Ultimately, what really matters isn’t the amount of greenhouse gas emissions; what matters is the higher temperatures and their impact on humans. And on that front, a gas like methane is much worse than carbon dioxide. It drives the temperature up immediately, and by quite a bit. (loc 329)</p>

<p>Still, there is a lot that scientists do know and can state with confidence about what will happen if we don’t get to zero. Here are a few key points. The earth is warming, it’s warming because of human activity, and the impact is bad and will get much worse. (loc 372)</p>

<p>As for the cost of removing a ton of carbon from the air, that figure hasn’t been firmly established, but it’s at least $200 per ton. With some innovation, I think we can realistically expect it to get down to $100 per ton, so that’s the number I’ll use. That gives us the following equation: 51 billion tons per year x $100 per ton = $5.1 trillion per year (loc 947)</p>

<p>It takes a really long time to adopt new sources of energy. Notice how in 60 years coal went from 5 percent of the world’s energy supply to nearly 50 percent. But natural gas reached only 20 percent in the same amount of time. (loc 634)</p>
<p>Computer chips are an outlier. They get better because we figure out how to cram more transistors on each one, but there’s no equivalent breakthrough to make cars use a million times less gas. (loc 664)</p>
<p>In more than a century, fuel economy has improved by less than a factor of three. (loc 666)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mixture of literary commentary and discussion of historicity]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Shakespeare: a Survey</em> is a set of essays, one for each of Shakespeare’s plays, in chronological order of when they were first performed.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the mix of literary commentary and the analysis of the historicity of the plays – overall, Chambers generally skews in favour of Shakespeare writing the plays (<em>Titus Andronicus</em> is supposedly quite a controversial one), though for some of the minor plays he is doubtful.</p>
<p>Unlike your literature teacher in school, Chambers is willing to be critical of Shakespeare. Of particular note is his dislike of <em>The</em> <em>Tempest</em> , which is certainly a nonconsensus view – <em>The Tempest</em> is often lauded for its deep complexity:</p>
<p>Chambers’ criticism does somewhat resonate. Perhaps barring Prospero’s last soliloquy, <em>The Tempest</em> oftentimes feels flat and excessively fanciful. There is better tragedy to be found in <em>King Lear</em>, tragicomedy in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> , and romance in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> . Yet perhaps out of my literary ignorance, there are several complexities within <em>The Tempest</em> that I enjoy – the contrast of Ariel and Caliban despite both being slaves to Prospero; the metaphor of the playwright as the magician.</p>
<p>The <em>Survey</em> is somewhat old-fashioned, which I suppose is more than reasonable given that the essays were written at the turn of the 20th century. For instance, it presupposes that the reader is adept at reading some ancient Greek – “hubris” is rendered as <em>ὕβρις</em> (a physics degree was unironically good preparation for this). Furthermore, I confess that I often found my eyes glazing over for some of the essays on plays I haven’t yet read – the <em>Survey</em> requires a reasonable degree of familiarity with the works.</p>
<p>Overall, the <em>Survey</em> has been a nice way to renew my appreciation of Shakespeare’s classics, and equally, a source of motivation for me to go and fill in the blanks in my education.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Literature, unlike life, must simplify its issues, and that by selection and concentration alone can it hope to grip and fasten to the predetermined mood the wandering spirit of man</p>
<p><em>If literature were a 1:1 replica of life it would just be life.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Here, then, is the function of the supernatural in <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> . The mystery, so to call it, the inexplicability which is bound up with the central idea of the play, is the existence of that freakish irresponsible element of human nature out of which, to the eye of the comic spirit, the ethical and emotional vagaries of lovers take their rise”.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The tragic ineffectiveness of the speculative intellect in a world of action, that is the keynote of [Hamlet]. In Hamlet, as in Brutus, the idealist gets the worst of it, and we are left to wonder at the irony of things by which it is so.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In other respects, the grouping of <em>Othello</em> with <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>King Lear</em> is complete. Already the subtle change has come over Shakespeare’s attitude towards the problems of existence whereby cosmic tragedy has replaced the earlier psychological tragedy of <em>Julius Caesar</em> and of <em>Hamlet</em> . The issue has shifted from the relations of man and man to the relations of man and his creator.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[On the supernatural]</p>
<p>“It is Shakespeare’s confession of ignorance, of the fact that in his observation of life he has come just there upon something which baffles analysis, something which is, but which cannot be quite accounted for”.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The practical omnipotence which Prospero derives from his magic arts takes all vitality from the plots which he unravels and from the conflict between hero and villains which they represent.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfect book for a junior commodity trader]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Trader Construction Kit</em> is the perfect book for a junior on a commodity trading desk. Any new hire in such a role should spend their first week reading this <em>TCK</em> (while getting set up with tech infra etc) – it clarifies much of the jargon you are bound to hear and gives you the basic mental models needed to be on the same page as your colleagues. Of course, part of the job is for you to develop your own mental models and processes, but this is made significantly easier by having a common language.</p>
<p>Rubano explains what fundamental analysis means in the context of commodities – the construction of supply and demand “balances” to identify if there is going to be a surplus or deficit. His treatment of technical analysis is excellent, explaining the theory behind the indicators while having a strong awareness of the limitations. For what it’s worth, I personally see a sort of a “bell curve meme” around TA wherein professional traders have a begrudging respect for the value of technicals. TCK also gives reasonably good introductions to spread trading, options, and risk management, though of course more depth on each of those can be found in other resources.</p>
<p>My favourite chapters were the ones on the <em>craft</em> of trading (as opposed to knowledge about finance/commodity concepts. “Developing a Cohesive Market View” explains how to synthesise fundamentals, technicals, and market flows into a tradable view; “Managing Positions &amp; Portfolios” discusses how to think about live positions – when to add/cut risk etc; “Navigating the Corporate Culture” gives an insightful take on principal-agent problems, expectations management, and career risk.</p>
<p>From reading a typical trading book, one gets the impression that it is purely an intellectual/quantitative poker game – making the best decisions with current information. This neglects the reality that almost everyone starting in the business does so under someone else’s roof; accordingly, there is a metagame beyond Bayesian decision-making. For example, how should one manage a joint book? How do you interact with CIOs or risk allocators? What should you tell your boss when you experience a big loss? These topics fall in the domain of the metagame rather than just the game – and can be the difference between mediocrity and stunning success.</p>

        <updated>2023-03-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Twelve Caesars</em> is a lively set of portraits of the early Emperors, spanning the late Republic (Julius Caesar in the Gallic Wars, 68BC) to the birth of the Empire (Augustus in 31BC), to the end of the Julio-Claudians (Nero’s death in 68AD) to the Flavians (Vespasian to Domitian, ending 96AD).</p>
<p>It’s remarkable that the Empire survived its first hundred years. After the legendary Julius Caesar and Augustus, things went rapidly downhill. There was Tiberius, who split his time between torturing his enemies and enjoying the pleasures of the flesh in Campania; Caligula, who developed quite a taste for murder and wanted to make his horse a Consul; Nero, who was far more interested in theatre than ruling; and the Three Stooges in the Year of the Four Emperors – Galba, Vitellius, and Otho.</p>
<p>The highlight of the book, without a doubt, was the tale of Nero. It is surreal, hilarious, and dark. Deeply passionate about the arts, it seems that Nero wanted to be remembered more for his skills in the lyre than his rule of the empire. Vain and neurotic, he drained the state coffers for the sake of extravagant performances. Yes, later on, he got a taste for murdering people (his mother was not spared) and he was notably cruel to Christians… but in the context of the other emperors, his cruelty doesn’t stand out. His last words, as he put a knife into his neck to avoid a more gruesome ending after a coup: “what an artist dies in me”. I find myself having to agree…</p>
<p><em>The Twelve Caesars</em> is oftentimes amusing, though sometimes it is “laughing at Suetonius” rather than “laughing with Suetonius”. He is trying his best to be a matter-of-fact historian, which often clashes with the farcical behaviour of the emperors and the near comical levels of cruelty. He dutifully reports the physical details of each Emperor and the omens preceding their ascensions and deaths – surely any reasonable observer would consider the death of Caligula unsurprising, given the lightning that struck the capitol a few days before!</p>
<p>Amidst the fanciful extremes of bravery, ineptitude, cruelty, and general tomfoolery, we see that human nature is essentially unchanged. The main takeaway is that <em>power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely</em> . Even Nero and Caligula were initially well-liked by the people and seen as just rulers. But once they truly internalised the utter lack of consequence to any of their actions, less noble instincts took hold. Who among us can confidently say we would be any different?</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&quot;At Cadiz [Caesar] saw a statue of Alexander the Great in the Temple of Hercules, and was overheard to sigh impatiently: vexed, it seems, that at an age when Alexander had already conquered the whole world, he himself had done nothing in the least epoch-making.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The origin for that story in</em> <em><a href="/?books=range" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Range</a></em> **</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[After ousting the other consul]</p>
<p>“Caesar was thus able to govern alone and do very much as he pleased. It became a joke to sign and seal bogus documents: ‘Executed during the Consulship of Julius and Caesar’, rather than ‘during the Consulship of Bibulus and Caesar’.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Indeed, it is said that [Augustus] took the disaster [The Battle of the Teutoberg Forest] so deeply to heart that he left his hair and beard untrimmed for months; he would often beat his head on a door, shouting: ‘Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions!’</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At another banquet a very obscure candidate for the quaestorship drained a huge two-handled tankard of wine at Tiberius’ challenge, whereupon he was preferred to rival candidates from the noblest families.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Germanicus is everywhere described as having been of outstanding physical and moral excellence. He was handsome, courageous, a past-master of Greek and Latin oratory and letters, conspicuously kind-hearted, and gifted with the powerful desire and capacity for winning respect and inspiring affection. Only his legs were somehwat undeveloped, but he strengthened them by assiduous exercise on horseback after meals.</p>
<p><em>Never skip leg day</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Nero was convinced that nobody could remain chaste or pure in any part of his body, but that most people concealed their secret vices; hence, if anyone confessed to obscene practices, Nero forgave him all his other crimes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Nero believed that fortunes were made to be squandered, and whoever could account for every penny he spent seemed to him a stingy miser. ‘True gentlemen,’ he said, ‘always throw their money about’</p>
<p><em>Ross Johnson in Barbarians at the Gate</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Vespasian openly engaged in business dealings which would have disgraced even a private citizen – such as cornering the stocks of certain commodities and then putting them back on the market at inflated prices.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compelling explorations of “toy” universes]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A good collection of short stories, overlapping partially with <a href="/?books=exhalation" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Exhalation</a>.</p>
<p>Many scifi authors have the tendency to explore advanced technology or physics – worlds that expand on our own. A common theme in Ted Chiang’s work is going the opposite way: choosing a universe with much simpler physics (<em>Tower of Babylon, Exhalation, Seventy-Two Letters)</em> and exploring what life would be like, with a similar flavour to magical realism.</p>
<p>The best story in this anthology is <em>Hell is the Absence of God</em>, set in a world where Judeo-Christian metaphysics is part of quotidian life: angel visitations occur regularly, God makes miracles happen, and you can see souls ascend to heaven. It’s a nice exploration of the problem of suffering, since it controls for the variable of the existence of God. The subversion of religious tropes is a recurring motif in Chiang’s stories, and he consistently delivers – see also <em>Omphalos</em> from <a href="/?books=exhalation" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Exhalation</a>.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, my least favourite piece was the eponymous <em>Story of Your Life</em> , which is the premise of the excellent film <em>Arrival</em> . The ideas are excellent, but it just doesn’t work terribly well in textual form. <em>Arrival</em> manages to create a Louise Banks with both emotion and detachment (due to her variant perception of time), while in <em>Story of Your Life</em> , Banks is one-dimensional and almost robotic. I certainly came away with a renewed appreciation of the screenwriter Eric Heisserer’s imagination and Denis Villeneuve’s artistry.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Understand –</em> superintelligence drug<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">While superintelligence drugs are a common trope in fiction (<em>Limitless</em> , <em>Flowers for Algernon</em> ), I enjoyed Ted Chiang’s take on it.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">It’s a good complement to <a href="/?books=prometheus-rising" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Prometheus Rising</a>: Chiang explores the “metaprogramming” circuit – what happens when the brain is so advanced that it can reprogram itself.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Interesting discussion on the goal of superintelligence: the protagonist seeks knowledge for his own sake, Reynolds wants to save humanity.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Fascinating climax: Reynolds designs an attack that only works against ultimate superintelligence – getting the superintelligence to design its own Gödel sentence!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Division by Zero –</em> a genius mathematician proves that arithmetic is an inconsistent formal system</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Story of Your Life</em> – the inspiration for <em>Arrival</em> . A linguist learns to perceive time differently by comprehending an alien language<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">This was the most disappointing of the stories in the anthology, if only because <em>Arrival</em> gave me such high expectations.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The movie is <em>far</em> better than the story… it makes me even more appreciative of the artistry of Denis Villaneuve.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The most interesting part was the brief discussion of heptapod physics vs human physics: because they perceive time differently, all of their physics is formulated in terms of the principle of least action, which is a little unintuitive for humans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Seventy-Two Letters</em> – with the right incantation, inanimate matter can be brought to life (like the legend of the golem).<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">This entire story is a fascinating allegory of molecular genetics.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">With the right incantation (DNA sequence), one can get chemicals to become animate.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">What makes DNA magical is that it also codes for its own reproduction (see <a href="/?books=g%C3%B6del-escher-bach-an-eternal-golden-braid" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</a> for more)</li>

<p>As always, the roles one plays become recognizable only with greater maturity. To me, these people seem like children on a playground; I&#39;m amused by their earnestness, and embarrassed to remember myself doing those same things. Their activities are appropriate for them, but I couldn&#39;t bear to participate now; when I became a man, I put away childish things. I will deal with the world of normal humans only as needed to support myself. (loc 754) ...</p>
<p>I&#39;m reminded of the Confucian concept of ren: inadequately conveyed by &quot;benevolence,&quot; that quality which is quintessentially human, which can only be cultivated through interaction with others, and which a solitary person cannot manifest. It&#39;s one of many such qualities. And here am I, with people, people everywhere, yet not a one to interact with. I&#39;m only a fraction of what a complete individual with my intelligence could be. (loc 821) ... All that I once knew theoretically about my mind, I now see detailed explicitly. The undercurrents of sex, aggression, and self-preservation, translated by the conditioning of my childhood, clash with and are sometimes disguised as rational thought. I recognize all the causes of my every mood, the motives behind my every decision. What can I do with this knowledge? Much of what is conventionally described as &quot;personality&quot; is at my discretion; the higher-level aspects of my psyche define who I am now. I can send my mind into a variety of mental or emotional states, yet remain ever aware of the state and able to restore my original condition. (loc 875) ... My mind collapses back into a state of sanity. I must keep a tighter rein over my self. When I&#39;m in control at the meta-programming level, my mind is perfectly self-repairing; I could restore myself from states that resemble delusion or amnesia. But if I drift too far on the meta-programming level, my mind might become an unstable structure, and then I would slide into a state beyond mere insanity. I will program my mind to forbid itself from moving beyond its own reprogramming range. (loc 945) <em>Undoubtedly influenced by Robert Anton Wilson’s</em> <em><a href="/?books=prometheus-rising" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Prometheus Rising</a></em> <em>and the metaprogramming circuit.</em> ... &lt;Your indifference toward the normals would be justified if you were enlightened; your realm wouldn&#39;t intersect theirs. But as long as you and I can still comprehend their affairs, we can&#39;t ignore them.&gt; (loc 1042) ... He considers intelligence to be a means, while I view it as an end in itself. Greater intelligence would be of little use to him. At his present level, he can find the best possible solution to any problem within the realm of human experience, and many beyond. All he&#39;d require is sufficient time to implement his solution. There&#39;s no point in further discussion. By mutual assent, we begin. (loc 1049) ... Myself, constructing the simulator.

<p>the only way to learn an unknown language is to interact with a native speaker, and by that I mean asking questions, holding a conversation, that sort of thing. Without that, it&#39;s simply not possible. So if you want to learn the aliens&#39; language, someone with training in field linguistics— whether it&#39;s me or someone else— will have to talk with an alien. Recordings alone aren&#39;t sufficient.&quot; (loc 1487) ... &quot;In their spoken language, a noun has a case marker indicating whether it&#39;s a subject or object. In their written language, however, a noun is identified as subject or object based on the orientation of its logogram relative to that of the verb. Here, take a look.&quot; I pointed at one of the figures. &quot;For instance, when &#39;heptapod&#39; is integrated with &#39;hears&#39; this way, with these strokes parallel, it means that the heptapod is doing the hearing.&quot; I showed him a different one. &quot;When they&#39;re combined this way, with the strokes perpendicular, it means that the heptapod is being heard. This morphology applies to several verbs. (loc 1733) ... The State Department instructed us to reveal as little as possible about humanity, in case that information could be used as a bargaining chip in subsequent negotiations. We obliged, though it didn&#39;t require much effort: the heptapods never asked questions about anything. Whether scientists or tourists, they were an awfully incurious bunch. (loc 1821) ... According to Gary, the heptapods&#39; formulation of physics was indeed topsy-turvy relative to ours. Physical attributes that humans defined using integral calculus were seen as fundamental by the heptapods. (loc 1908) what kind of worldview did the heptapods have, that they would consider Fermat&#39;s principle the simplest explanation of light refraction? What kind of perception made a minimum or maximum readily apparent to them? (loc 1917) ... &quot;The light can&#39;t start traveling in any old direction and make course corrections later on, because the path resulting from such behavior wouldn&#39;t be the fastest possible one. The light has to do all its computations at the very beginning.&quot; I thought to myself, the ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in. I knew what that reminded me of. I looked up at Gary. &quot;That&#39;s what was bugging me.&quot; (loc 1987) ... As I grew more fluent, semagraphic designs would appear fully formed, articulating even complex ideas all at once. My thought processes weren&#39;t moving any faster as a result, though. Instead of racing forward, my mind hung balanced on the symmetry underlying the semagrams. The semagrams seemed to be something more than language; they were almost like mandalas. I found myself in a meditative state, contemplating the way in which premises and conclusions were interchangeable. There was no direction inherent in the way propositions were connected, no &quot;train of thought&quot; moving along a particular route; all the components in an act of reasoning were equally powerful, all having identical precedence. (loc 2020) ... the Book of Ages must be right, by definition; yet no matter what the Book says she&#39;ll do, she can choose to do otherwise. How can these two facts be reconciled? They can&#39;t be, was the common answer. A volume like the Book of Ages is a logical impossibility, for the precise reason that its existence would result in the above contradiction. Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn&#39;t accessible to readers: that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges. The existence of free will meant that we couldn&#39;t know the future. And we knew free will existed because we had direct experience of it. Volition was an intrinsic part of consciousness. Or was it? What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would? (loc 2091) <em>I don’t think this is a particularly interesting take on free will/predetermination</em> ... Consider the phenomenon of light hitting water at one angle, and traveling through it at a different angle. Explain it by saying that a difference in the index of refraction caused the light to change direction, and one saw the world as humans saw it. Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it. Two very different interpretations. The physical universe was a language with a perfectly ambiguous grammar. Every physical event was an utterance that could be parsed in two entirely different ways, one causal and the other teleological, both valid, neither one disqualifiable no matter how much context was available. (loc 2124) ... knowledge of the future was incompatible with free will. What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that future, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don&#39;t talk about it. Those who&#39;ve read the Book of Ages never admit to it. (loc 2187) ... For the heptapods, all language was performative. Instead of using language to inform, they used language to actualize. Sure, heptapods already knew what would be said in any conversation; but in order for their knowledge to be true, the conversation would have to take place. (loc 2200) ...</div></details></p>

He and Dr. Ashbourne had assumed that creating animals capable of reproducing meant giving them preformed foetuses, because that was the method employed by nature. As a result they had overlooked another possibility: that if a creature could be expressed in a name, reproducing that creature was equivalent to transcribing the name. An organism could contain, instead of a tiny analogue of its body, a lexical representation instead. (loc 3192) ... Humanity would become a vehicle for the name as well as a product of it.

Without DNT humans could not fully grasp prior developments nor effectively utilize the new tools needed to conduct research, while metahumans continued to improve DNT and rely on it even more. (loc 3211) ... Textual hermeneutics became popular first, since there were already terabytes of metahuman publications whose translations, while cryptic, were presumably not entirely inaccurate. Deciphering these texts bears little resemblance to the task performed by traditional paleographers, but progress continues: (loc 3219) ...

<p>Neil was born with a congenital abnormality that caused his left thigh to be externally rotated and several inches shorter than his right; the medical term for it was proximal femoral focus deficiency. Most people he met assumed God was responsible for this, but Neil&#39;s mother hadn&#39;t witnessed any visitations while carrying him; his condition was the result of improper limb development during the sixth week of gestation, nothing more. (loc 3250)<em>This is a great opening. One starts to assume that Neil is surrounded by weird hyper-religious people, but it’s soon revealed that this is the world the story is set in.</em> ... It was an unexceptional visitation, smaller in magnitude than most but no different in kind, bringing blessings to some and disaster to others. In this instance the angel was Nathanael, making an appearance in a downtown shopping district. Four miracle cures were effected: the elimination of carcinomas in two individuals, the regeneration of the spinal cord in a paraplegic, and the restoration of sight to a recently blinded person. (loc 3265) ... Nathanael hadn&#39;t delivered any specific message; the angel&#39;s parting words, which had boomed out across the entire visitation site, were the typical Behold the power of the Lord. Of the eight casualties that day, three souls were accepted into Heaven and five were not, a closer ratio than the average for deaths by all causes. (loc 3274) ... Like every other nondevout person, Neil had never expended much energy on where his soul would end up; he&#39;d always assumed his destination was Hell, and he accepted that. That was the way of things, and Hell, after all, was not physically worse than the mortal plane. It meant permanent exile from God, no more and no less; the truth of this was plain for anyone to see on those occasions when Hell manifested itself. (loc 3300) ... Perhaps, he thought, it&#39;d be better to live in a story where the righteous were rewarded and the sinners were punished, even if the criteria for righteousness and sinfulness eluded him, than to live in a reality where there was no justice at all. It would mean casting himself in the role of sinner, so it was hardly a comforting lie, but it offered one reward that his own ethics couldn&#39;t: believing it would reunite him with Sarah. (loc 3518) ... In the past there&#39;d been some doubt as to whether Heaven&#39;s light could indeed overcome all the spiritual obstacles to becoming saved. The debate ended after the case of Barry Larsen, a serial rapist and murderer who, while disposing of the body of his latest victim, witnessed an angel&#39;s visitation and saw Heaven&#39;s light. At Larsen&#39;s execution, his soul was seen ascending to Heaven, much to the outrage of his victims&#39; families. Priests tried to console them, assuring them— on the basis of no evidence whatsoever— that Heaven&#39;s light must have subjected Larsen to many lifetimes&#39; worth of penance in a moment, but their words provided little comfort. (loc 3576) ... To maximize their chances of being in the narrow shaft of Heaven&#39;s light, they followed the angel as closely as possible during its visitation; depending on the angel involved, this might mean staying alongside the funnel of a tornado, the wavefront of a flash flood, or the expanding tip of a chasm as it split apart the landscape. Far more light-seekers died in the attempt than succeeded. Statistics about the souls of failed light-seekers were difficult to compile, since there were few witnesses to such expeditions, but the numbers so far were not encouraging. In sharp contrast to ordinary pilgrims who died without receiving their sought-after cure, of which roughly half were admitted into Heaven, every single failed light-seeker had descended to Hell. (loc 3593) ... He renounced all his previous anger and ambivalence and desire for answers. He was grateful for all the pain he&#39;d endured, contrite for not previously recognizing it as the gift it was, euphoric that he was now being granted this insight into his true purpose. He understood how life was an undeserved bounty, how even the most virtuous were not worthy of the glories of the mortal plane. For him the mystery was solved, because he understood that everything in life is love, even pain, especially pain. So minutes later, when Neil finally bled to death, he was truly worthy of salvation. And God sent him to Hell anyway. (loc 3689) ... though it&#39;s been many years that he has been in Hell, beyond the awareness of God, he loves Him still. That is the nature of true devotion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beautifully dark macrohistory of the universe]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Death’s End</em> is the beautifully dark end to <a href="/?books=the-three-body-problem" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Three-Body Problem</a> trilogy (<em>A Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> ). It begins where <a href="/?books=the-dark-forest" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Dark Forest</a> left off, with Earth and Trisolaris in an uneasy truce due to Earth’s ability to guarantee mutually-assured destruction. The first segment of the book is a fascinating exploration of the strategy and politics surrounding such a stalemate; I deeply enjoyed the discussion of “Deterrence Game Theory”, which is essentially an adjacent field to the Cosmic Sociology introduced previously. But once Luo Ji steps down as the Swordholder – the person with the nuclear codes, so to speak – the book rapidly becomes dark. Liu explores the mass hysteria and horrors that result from the imminent invasion, and subsequently when the mutually assured destruction is activated, how humans prepare for the Dark Forest destruction of the solar system.</p>
<p>The book is messy at times, as if struggling to contain the weight of its own ideas; because of this, if pressed, I would say that <em>Death’s End</em> falls somewhat flat compared to <em>The Dark Forest</em> . But really, I prefer to think of the trilogy as one combined masterpiece, drawing on many ideas from other works of science fiction: the politicisation within a species (Asimov’s <em>The Gods Themselves)</em>, excursions into higher-dimensional space (explored in detail by Greg Egan in <a href="/?books=diaspora" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Diaspora</a> among others), the cosmic wonder of alien megaliths (Clarke’s <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em> and <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> ), and the Lovecraftian cosmic horror of unfathomably powerful beings. There is a steady crescendo in scope: from Earth’s domestic politics in <em>The Three Body Problem</em> , to the Trisolaris-Earth war in <em>The Dark Forest</em> , to the dark macrohistory of the universe in <em>Death’s End</em> .</p>
<p>With this in mind, <em>Death’s End</em> is like the finale of Tchaikovsky’s <em>1812 Overture</em> : an immense-bordering-on-excessive climax (with cannons!) that validates the thousand-page buildup. But this climax is certainly not in a major key like the <em>1812</em> , rather, it is a cosmic horror deeper than that of Lovecraft – the idea that the universe we live in has been fundamentally and irreversibly shaped by mutual destruction under the Dark Forest principle.</p>

<p>When humanity finally learned that the universe was a dark forest in which everyone hunted everyone else, the child who had once cried out for contact by the bright campfire put out the fire and shivered in the darkness. Even a spark terrified him. During the first few days, even mobile phone use was forbidden, and antennas around the world were forcibly shut down. Such a move, which would have once caused riots in the streets, was widely supported by the populace. (loc 1575)</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The dark forest theory had a profound impact on human civilization. That child sitting by the ashes of the campfire turned from optimism to isolation and paranoia, a loner in the universe. (loc 1591)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>People turned their attention to deterrence itself, and a new field of study was born: deterrence game theory. The main elements of deterrence are these: the deterrer and the deteree (in dark forest deterrence, humanity and Trisolaris); the threat (broadcasting the location of Trisolaris so as to ensure the destruction of both worlds); the controller (the person or organization holding the broadcast switch); and the goal (forcing Trisolaris to abandon its invasion plan and to share technology with humanity). When the deterrent is the complete destruction of both the deterrer and the deteree, the system is said to be in a state of ultimate deterrence. (loc 1954)</p>
<p><em>I’m interested to know whether there is any actual basis for deterrence game theory. It seems like the kind of thing Von Neumann et al would have considered during the Cold War.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the key to the success of ultimate deterrence is the belief by the deteree that the threat will almost certainly be carried out if the deteree thwarts the deterrer’s goals. This probability, or degree of deterrence, is an important parameter in deterrence game theory. The degree of deterrence must exceed 80 percent for the deterrer to succeed. (loc 1961)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>At the beginning of the Deterrence Era, both worlds carefully analyzed Luo Ji’s personality and built up detailed mathematical models. Human and Trisolaran deterrence game theorists reached remarkably similar conclusions: Depending on his mental state at the moment deterrence failed, Luo Ji’s degree of deterrence hovered between 91.9 percent and 98.4 percent. Trisolaris would not gamble with such odds. (loc 1972)</p>
<p><em>I love the premise of Earth and Trisolaris reluctantly working together to figure out the situation they are in: an unbelievably tense cooperation forced by the logic of deterrence.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Humanity came to realize that all policies with respect to the Trisolarans had to take the Swordholder into account. Without his approval, no human policy had any effect on Trisolaris. Thus, the Swordholder became a powerful dictator, much like the Wallfacers had. (loc 2012)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Never explicitly stated, and perhaps not even consciously understood, a gravitational wave ship was too powerful—so powerful that it terrified its creator. If something—a droplet attack or something else—forced such ships to depart for deep space, and they could never return to the Solar System due to the presence of enemy threats, they would turn into copies of Blue Space and Bronze Age, or something even more horrific. (loc 2864)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>At its root, this fear was a fear of dark forest deterrence itself. This was characteristic of ultimate deterrence: The deterrer and the deteree shared the same terror of deterrence itself. (loc 2869)</p>

But the dark forest exists everywhere between those sharing the same dimensions. (loc 4114)</p>

<p>In the cosmos, the trail of a curvature propulsion drive could be a sign of danger, as well as a safety announcement. A trail far away from a world was the former; a trail that shrouded a world the latter. It was like a noose, indicating danger and aggression when held in the hand, but safety when wrapped around the holder’s own neck. (loc 8986)</p>

<p>“There’s only one way to detect the presence of the two-dimensional Solar System from three-dimensional space: gravity. The gravity of the Solar System still has an effect, so, in that empty space ought to be detectable as an invisible source of gravity.” Cheng Xin and AA looked at each other thoughtfully. “Sounds like dark matter, doesn’t it?” Yifan laughed. Then he changed the subject. (loc 9217)</p>

<p>The universe of the Edenic Age was ten-dimensional. The speed of light back then wasn’t only much higher—rather, it was close to infinity. Light back then was capable of action at a distance, and could go from one end of the cosmos to the other within a Planck time…. If you had been to four-dimensional space, you would have some vague hint of how beautiful that ten-dimensional Garden must have been.” (loc 9392)</p>

<p>Thereafter, the remaining two suns formed a stable double-star system, but no life would witness the regular sunrises and sunsets. The cinders of the exploded star and the incinerated Trisolaris formed two vast accretion discs around the two suns, like two gray graveyards. (loc 4423)</p>
<p><em>Obviously some cosmic humour here – the Trisolaran’s initial drive to conquer Earth was the desire to have a stable system, rather than the unstable three bodies..</em></p>

<p>“True. I personally got to see three-dimensional space from four-dimensional space, but it’s not possible to see the two-dimensional world from three dimensions. This is because three-dimensional space has thickness, meaning that there is a dimension that could stop and scatter the light from four-dimensional space, making it visible from four dimensions. But two-dimensional space has no thickness, so light from three-dimensional space passes through it without hindrance. The two-dimensional world is completely transparent and cannot be seen.” (loc 9211)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmic Sociology]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Dark Forest</em> is a rare sequel that both validates and exceeds its predecessor. It builds on the strange universe of the <a href="/?books=the-three-body-problem" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Three-Body Problem</a>, in which Earth encounters the militant, technologically-advanced Trisolarans. The Trisolarans have sent “sophons” – higher-dimensional computer-particles that can read digital information, transmit data back to Trisolaris instantly, and interfere with physics experiments.</p>
<p>So that’s the setup. Earth has a few centuries to prepare for the Trisolaran Invasion, given the constraints: no new physics and the Trisolarans can see everything (including secrets in locked vaults or encrypted computers. Fortunately for Earth, sophons can’t read minds and Trisolarans do not understand deception, making them vulnerable to strategic ruses.</p>
<p>Liu’s approach thenceforth is almost scientific; through various characters and factions, he explores different solutions given these boundary conditions. I suppose I have just described the archetype of most sci-fi novels (or perhaps even fiction) – characters reacting to author-chosen constraints – but Liu’s approach is compelling because it is inventive, somewhat rigorous (or at least within the realm of plausibility w.r.t. the vibe of the universe in the first book), and ultimately illuminating.</p>
<p>The highlight of the book is the theory of Cosmic Sociology. Regrettably, this idea was not entirely new to me (see xkcd 1377), but even some awareness of the concept didn’t temper the excitement as Liu masterfully traced the logic to its tragic inevitability: intelligent species cannot peacefully co-exist.</p>
<p>While <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> focuses on ideas at the occasional expense of character development, <em>The Dark Forest</em> manages to pursue an even grander scope without sacrifice in that regard. Luo Ji is a charming antihero and several of the other characters are equally fascinating and multidimensional (barring the occasional caricature). <em>The Dark Forest</em> dials down the political intrigue compared to <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> (whose emphasis on ideology is somewhat divisive amongst sci-fi fans), while retaining the motif of actions being driven by ideology.</p>
<p>Lastly, the novel is superbly constructed: “small scale” events like the conflict between spaceships <em>Blue Space</em> and <em>Gravity</em> are used to elucidate the central ideas. This is seldom done well by sci-fi – often the scope of the ideas exceeds the author’s ability to convey them naturally (PK Dick is often in this category; <a href="/?books=snow-crash" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Snow Crash</a> likewise resorts to lazy exposition). But Liu synthesises ideas, characters, and narrative together into a page-turner that left me hungry for more (I started <a href="/?books=deaths-end" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Death’s End</a> the same day I finished <em>The Dark Forest</em> !).</p>

<p>The doctrine of Escapism arose alongside the Trisolar Crisis. Its primary argument holds that given the locked state of humanity’s advanced sciences, it does not make any sense to plan for a defense of Earth and the Solar System in four and a half centuries. Considering the extent to which human technology can develop over the next four centuries, a more realistic goal would be to construct starships to enable a small portion of the human race to flee to outer space, thereby avoiding the total extinction of human civilization. (loc 587)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“The source of this defeatism stems primarily from the worship of technology, and the underestimation or complete dismissal of the role of human initiative and the human spirit in war. It is a development and extension of techno-triumphalism and the ‘weapons decide everything’ theory that has cropped up in the armed forces in recent years. (loc 1157)</p>

<p>“What sort of a society is it when thought is completely transparent? What sort of culture does it produce? What sort of politics? No scheming, no pretending.” What are “scheming” and “pretending”? (loc 229)</p>
<p><em>Similar concept to The Light of Other Days</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“We should be aware of this one fact: Strategic and tactical tricks do not advance in proportion to technological progress. Precise intelligence has proven that the Trisolarans communicate through direct, open thoughts, making them highly deficient at tricks, camouflage, and deception, and giving human civilization a huge advantage over the enemy. This is one advantage we can’t afford to lose. The founders of the Wallfacer Project believe that a number of other strategic plans should proceed in parallel to the mainstream defense program, and that these plans should be secret, not transparent to the enemy. A number of proposals were put forward, but ultimately only the Wallfacer Project is feasible. (loc 1558)</p>
<p><em>We generally assume that morality, deception, self-awareness etc correlate with technological advancement. But this doesn’t have to be true! Asimov’s Foundation series also explores the different possible axes of technological advancement.</em></p>

<p>How are we supposed to know whether or not you have already started work? He now understood that the Wallfacers had a mission far weirder than any in history, its logic cold and twisted, yet unyielding as the chains that bound Prometheus. It was an unliftable curse impossible for the Wallfacers to break under their own strength. No matter how he struggled, the totality of everything would be greeted with the Wallfacer smile and imbued with the significance of the Wallfacer Project: How are we supposed to know whether or not you are working?

<p>At almost the same time as Starship Earth’s Battle of Darkness was going on, a similar tragedy was taking place far on the other side of the Solar System.

<p>Humanity’s shared species, cultural similarities, interconnected ecosystem, and close distances means that, in this environment, the chain of suspicion will only extend a level or two before it’s resolved through communication. But in space, the chain of suspicion can be very long. Something like the Battle of Darkness will already have taken place before communication can resolve it.” (loc 8189)</p>

<p>once I’ve received your message and know of your existence, the chain of suspicion is established between us. If at any time I experience a technological explosion that suddenly puts me far ahead of you, then I’m stronger than you. On the scale of the universe, several hundred years is the snap of a finger. And it might be that my knowledge of your existence and the information I received from our communication was the perfect spark to set off that explosion. That means that even though I’m just a newborn or growing civilization, I’m still a big danger to you.” (loc 8209)</p>

<p>The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds other life—another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi Paradox. […]</p>
<p>But in this dark forest, there’s a stupid child called humanity, who has built a bonfire and is standing beside it shouting, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’ (loc 8234)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seek concurrent necessity: by the time xyz happens, what else must have happened?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Next Perfect Trade</em> is a valuable book about the philosophy of trading. It has a similar flavour to <a href="/?books=soros-on-soros" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Soros on Soros</a>, interspersing somewhat abstract philosophical arguments with real market wisdom and examples of trades.</p>
<p>Gurevich discusses his framework for identifying macro trades. In brief, they should:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Align with the long-term expected value (i.e. taking into account trends and carry)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Involve simple instruments</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Be logically dominant.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of dominant trades is something new to me (the other points, while excellently explained, have been discussed in various other texts). Literally starting from first principles – modus ponens – Gurevich identifies several logical truths:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">We should trade on necessary conditions rather than sufficient conditions, for they are correct in a broader range of scenarios</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">More specifically, we want concurrent necessity: if by the time A happens, B must have already happened, then it does not make sense to bet on A.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if this was my only takeaway from the book, it will have been worth it: a simple razor (that is common sense once you’ve chewed through the logic) to help choose between trade expressions.</p>
<p>Gurevich’s trading style is unlikely to be completely applicable to many finance professionals: few have a mandate as flexible as his, both in terms of the breadth of asset classes, and the tolerance for drawdowns. But many of his ideas are still widely applicable and they match with advice I have heard first-hand from several traders and PMs, for example: “don’t get cute” with trade implementation, don’t fight the Fed, trade with the trend, etc.</p>
<p>I want to find more examples of this type of book: new theoretical frameworks, applied to practical examples and distilled into key takeaways (<a href="/?books=geopolitical-alpha" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Geopolitical Alpha</a> is another great example).</p>

<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Any trading strategy requires the identification and exploitation of dislocations</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Find trades that are aligned with long term expected value:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Trend</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Carry</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Valuation</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Aligned with historic patterns (e.g. equities rebound from crashes)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Aligned with global growth and supertrends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Prefer simple instruments that pay off when your view is right: ”I don’t advocate unequivocally against using complex and leveraged financial instruments. Rather, I caution against the traders’ tendency to increase complexity out of fear of taking simple directional risk. Such complexity almost invariably increases transaction costs and the amount of risk variables.”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">If X ⇒ Y, bet on Y since it can happen in a broader range of scenarios.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Look for concurrent necessity: by the time A has happened, B must first have happened. Then bet on B.</li>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Overall philosophy</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>This book prepares you to use one specific kind of magic: the sword of necessity. It is a consistent intellectual approach to finding trades which work in the broadest range of economic scenarios. (loc 67)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I am an investment manager that specializes in long-horizon, discretionary global macro trading. (loc 74)</p>

<p>“Dislocation equals value.” Something has to be trading at the wrong price in order for someone to take advantage of the opportunity. So each trading style is essentially an answer to three questions:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How do you find dislocations?</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How do you profit from those dislocations?</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How do you manage your capital and control your losses when you are wrong? (loc 162)</li>
</ul>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Trend and carry</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The direction of the tide is the answer to questions like, “All else being equal, where are the things going?” or “Where are the things going in the long run?” Avoid trades that are expected to lose money if held for the long term, no matter how compelling the shorter horizon arguments for those trades are. (loc 232)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>catchy phrases, like “Don’t trade against the trend,” are not automatically universal truths. I prefer “Don’t trade against the trend in a market that tends to be trending.” (loc 271)</p>
<p><em>Distinguishes between apparent trend and fundamental autocorrelation.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When a massive and rapid market shift rectifies an existing price dislocation, it is tempting to declare the current price to be “fair” and exit the trade. But the momentum created by the past economic gravity and the past policy actions is likely to carry the price beyond the fair point. To give up on a trade at the economically “fair value” point (the bottom of the pendulum) is to give up precisely when the moment is at its greatest. (loc 321)</p>
<p><em>An intuitive idea: if we believe that there is short-term autocorrelation, then we don’t want to exit a long-horizon mean reversion trade until it is well past fair.</em></p>

<p>The intellectual principles introduced in this book will single out being short U.S. Bonds in 2014 as the worst trade ever. (loc 352)</p>

<p>to fight the pendulum forces of cyclical currency trends and the relentless momentum of secular interest rate and equity trends is an undeniable case of stacking the odds against oneself. (loc 358)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[On TRY] my preference is not to fight the tremendous carry. Rather, I would wait for a blow-up (a rapid depreciation on the high-yielding currency, like in 2001 or 2008 in this case), and try to get long lira on the cheap and collect both carry and currency appreciation for a couple of years. (loc 395)</p>

<p>The most interesting example of a carry trade, in my opinion, is US Treasuries (bonds, notes and bills). The global financial market has an axiom: US Government securities pose no risk of default whatsoever. (loc 397)</p>
<p><em>As Gurevich explains, even though this axiom is not a mathematical truth, it is a practical truth because the default of the US government is a true disaster case.</em></p>

<p>“The “intrinsic value” of a security is the maximum price that an investor would be willing to pay to own the security if she could not ever sell it.” I add for clarity: “nor could she lend this security or use it as collateral.” (loc 441)</p>

<p>even the people who correctly anticipated the mortgage crisis didn’t have an easy time of pinpointing the collapse or finding the correct strategy to take advantage of the bubble. For every John Paulson, there are a lot bear skeletons littering financial thoroughfares. Am I telling you that there is no way to take advantage of recognizing a bubble? No. There is one sure way. SIT IT OUT. If you know that stocks will collapse below current levels, stay flat! By the virtue of being in cash, you guarantee yourself a great buying opportunity (like in 2002 or 2009) with no risk of being squeezed. (loc 1011)</p>

<p>The central tendency of global economic growth and progress is to create a positive tidal force for certain asset classes. This force is especially evident with regards to the stock market, where a massive positive secular trend dominates. Any bearish strategies have to be formulated with the default forces of growth taken into account. (loc 1095)</p>

<p>Each time the price of any position changes for a noneconomic reason, the value of this position incrementally changes.

If I am betting on an FX (foreign exchange) move, I will start establishing the position as soon as I judge the location to be extreme, but I will wait (sometimes for years) till a favorable trend is established and then pile onto it, pyramiding47 my gains.

<p>An accommodative policy by the Central Bank leads to lower short-term rates, but to a higher long-term inflation expectations; the converse is also true. This decoupling is often counterintuitive. After all, shouldn’t lower rates lead to lower projected rates, and higher rates to higher projected rates? (loc 786)</p>

<p>Whenever the Fed is actively changing the rates policy, the market is very reluctant to project moves into the future. The forward rate expectations will decouple from current policy.

<p>The economic and political situations, both globally and in these particular countries, have evolved in many unpredictable directions. Yet it is easy to see that on those occasions when the cross was close to 1.05, it was a good buy — that is, one could go long Aussie vs. short Kiwi — and whenever it was at 1.35 or above, it was a good sell. Were those price swings directly correlated to specific macroeconomic conditions? Probably. One could overlay the AUDNZD chart with other data, such as the Aussie vs. US dollar, the pace of global growth, the performance of global stock markets, and so on. The most obvious factors to look at would be the prices of key exports: gold for Australia and food for New Zealand. In short, I have some ideas about the forces, which drive this cross, but those guesses are not as useful as just observing the clear historical pattern. Buy at 1.05, sell at 1.35. Easy, isn’t it?

<p>I suspect that the idea of tight stops came from the days of the market’s youth when information was slow to be disseminated, and it took time for prices to adjust to new inputs. In that world of such gradual adjustment to the news, it made sense to get out as soon as you realized you were wrong-footed. (loc 1165)</p>
<p>But modern information flows are nearly instantaneous; adjustments happen faster, and the market overshoots more frequently, especially when a multitude of players act on the same price triggers. The result is that “tight-stoppers” frequently get whipsawed by the price action. (loc 1168)</p>
<p><em>Logically, a stop loss only makes sense if you think that there is positive autocorrelation.</em></p>

<p>So if you have a profitable short-term technical strategy, by all means, trade it on its own value. But overlaying a rare and valuable long-horizon macro call with tight stops and technical entry points will only “muddy up” your risk profile and create a potential for missing your move. (loc 1292)</p>

<p>interest rates positions are so sensitive to the economic data and geopolitical risks that often you have no choice but to be flexible and reassess your views promptly and aggressively. A fairly common advice is, “Stop out not when you lose a certain amount of money, but when you know that you are wrong.” When your market view is based on price action, the price action alone can prove that you are wrong. (loc 1349)</p>
<p><em>This is often given as a reason for not using stops, and for a perfect Bayesian reasoner it makes sense. But in my view, one benefit of a stop is that it is a precommitment by your system two brain in order to prevent your system one brain from making further mistakes.</em></p>

<p>When I recognize a significant economic value, but choose for whatever reason to stay on the sidelines (I sometimes prefer to wait out an adverse trend for example), I set a rigorous stop into the trade. I refuse to allow myself to miss the trade when it starts moving in the expected direction. (loc 1362)</p>
<p><em>This is a nice idea!</em></p>

<p>Nothing makes me more interested in a trade than hearing others say, “Surely this position will make money eventually, but at this point it is too volatile and illiquid to enter.” (loc 1435)</p>
<p>They are definitely smart enough to see the big picture, but the fear of not having short-term control prevents them from capitalizing on their knowledge. Smaller size, longer term, bigger move. This is the way to enter the forest. (loc 1437)</p>

<p>Thus, I introduce the concept of psychologically neutral positioning. Your “core” position — the size of the trade you should gravitate towards over the long horizon should be psychologically neutral. When you are exactly at your core position on a given day, you don’t worry about the price action:</p>
<p>• If the market doesn’t do much, no problem. Your capital is not completely tied up, and you can afford to wait.</p>
<p>• If the market moves in your favor, great. You make money quickly and can sooner move on to the next trade.</p>
<p>• If the market goes against you, even better. You might get a great entry point to increase your position and make even more money. (loc 1447)</p>
<p><em>I wonder whether this idea can be formalised and tied into portfolio construction theory…</em></p>

<p>At one point, another junior trader proposed a trade which consisted of three interest rate swaps, which all canceled each other risk-wise and left us with a profit of about half-a-basis-point (0.005%). A senior trader responded to his idea: “Have you taken into the account the idiot factor?” The idiot factor turned out to be the possibility that you screwed something up in your reasoning, your calculations or your execution. (loc 1515)</p>
<p><em>If you’re a junior trader pitching a seemingly perfect idea to your boss and they don’t bite, it’s because of the idiot factor! And they’re probably right.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I am not saying that it is incorrect to take a position on the 10-year spread. It is a liquid and important instrument and the fact that it is more volatile than was previously thought only shows more money can be made by trading it. However, the idea that Treasuries can be used to hedge other instruments has been thoroughly debunked. If you own some risky bonds, selling Treasuries against them is not reducing your risk, but rather is changing your profile to an entirely different trade. (loc 1590)</p>
<p><em>Adding a “hedging” leg to a trade gives you new exposures.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Expressing your directional views via buying options is a lot like trading with stops and pyramiding when the trades are going in your favor. When you keep stopping out and putting your position on again, you may get whipsawed any number of times. If you are buying an option, you are essentially paying for a certain amount of “whipsawing” upfront. (loc 1597)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Some investors, who resent the pain inherent in paying for optionality or stopping out, resort to exotic derivative structures in order to avoid paying high premium. There all sorts of structures frequently used by investors: knock-ins, knock-outs, reverse knock-outs, buffers, costless collars, one-by-twos and so on. As a gross generalization, I will say that traders, who buy option combinations or exotic options to express their directional views, tend to pay for the appearance of saving on premium by being long optionality when the market performs the way they expect and short optionality when the market does something unexpected. It is exactly opposite of what you should be trying to achieve because owning optionality is designed specifically to protect you. (loc 1651)</p>

<p>I don’t advocate unequivocally against using complex and leveraged financial instruments. Rather, I caution against the traders’ tendency to increase complexity out of fear of taking simple directional risk. Such complexity almost invariably increases transaction costs and the amount of risk variables. (loc 1676)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Concurrent necessity</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>You don’t have to accept my assumptions. Choose your own. Just be very intellectually clear what assumptions you are using. Mathematicians do the same: they choose a non-self-contradictory set of axioms and use irrefutable logic to build a theory based on it. Choose different axioms and you will get a different theory. (loc 1905)</p>
<p>This is what I do. I read research and decide which paradigms I am willing to accept. And based on those paradigms, I strive to build a superior portfolio. (loc 1910)</p>

<p>Trade X dominates Trade Y, if under reasonable assumptions, X is likely to succeed in a strictly broader range of future scenarios than Y. (loc 1926)</p>

<p>If A &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;implies&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B, then A is the sufficient, and B is the necessary, and B is the dominant trade. (loc 1963)</p>
<p><em>You always went to bet on the trade that can win in more scenarios</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Saying A causes B, is very different than saying A implies B. To arrive at a logical implication we have to be more precise. “A is sufficient to cause B” signifies “A implies B.” But “A is necessary to cause B,” leads to the opposite direction of implication. (loc 2014)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Am I now demanding an immediate success from all trade ideas? Far from it. Not only do I not require immediacy, but I rarely specify any time horizon for a trading strategy. Rather, I demand concurrency. (loc 2101)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When we try to establish a strict dominance relationship between two trades that express a similar economic view via two separate asset classes, we need to establish the timelines of our implications. Mathematical statement A &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;implies&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B has no time in it. As we have seen, “If A happens, then B has to happen sometimes afterwards,” is not good enough to establish dominance of B. Rather we want to be able to say, “By the time A happens, B will have already happened.” This grammatically awkward statement captures the concurrent necessity. (loc 2111)</p>
<p>When considering a Trade A, I must ask myself, “What else has to have happened by the time A succeeds?” And if there is a Trade B which answers this question, “I will consider A an inferior trade.” (loc 2133)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>therein lays the secret of the chicken and the egg: the chicken can lay a new egg each day, but the egg takes three weeks to hatch. Translating into markets: • The chicken is the asset class whose movements cause immediate response in other asset classes. • The egg is the asset class that works slowly through the real economic forces and sometimes takes years to complete the feedback loop. (loc 2153)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This book is a hard pass from me.

By his own admission, <em>Machine Trading</em> was an excuse for Chan to learn about new topics… it really shows. Rather than providing a clear exposition of battle-hardened techniques that he has used in live trading, as in <a href="/?books=algorithmic-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Algorithmic Trading</a>, <em>Machine Trading</em> is a medley of basic techniques applied in rather naive ways.</p>
<p>The time series chapter literally puts asset prices into ARIMA models. The volatility chapter uses GARCH to trade volatility (seemingly realising the importance of implied volatility as an afterthought). The machine learning chapter has the quality of analysis one expects from a blog post on Medium applying LSTMs to stock prices. The last chapter, titled “Algorithmic Trading is Good for the Body and Soul” is bizarre… he is trying to pitch the benefits of being an independent algo trader, including such sage advice as:</p>
<p>The only redeeming feature of the book, which is why I’ve given it two stars instead of one, is that he provides code for all his ideas and is generally intellectually honest about their failures.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Algorithmic Trading</em> is a pleasure to read and a solid recommendation for a student interested in mid-frequency quant.</p>
<p>Chan’s blog is well known in the space (it is often one of the early resources one encounters). But I had mixed feelings about the first book – <em>Quantitative Trading</em> – it was too focused on nuts-and-bolts practicality, with a lot of ink spent describing different data vendors (many of which had become obsolete by the time of reading).</p>
<p><em>Algorithmic Trading</em> instead focuses more on the actual trading strategies: Chan walks through several real strategies, outlining the critical theory but also providing the implementation in Matlab.</p>
<p>While many of the tools he introduces may not be entirely new to people familiar with basic statarb ideas, Chan has a knack for identifying subtleties that other texts often gloss over (for example using log prices vs prices to construct mean-reverting spreads) and lucidly explaining the implications of various design choices. He contrasts multiple tools against each other both theoretically and experimentally – taking a step back, it is very helpful to see these examples of experiment design, which apply far beyond the specific strategies presented in the book.</p>

        <updated>2022-11-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intuition-focused intro to derivatives]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Financial Hacking</em> is a witty, practical, and informative introduction to financial derivatives that is a welcome reprieve from the overly-academic treatments common in the space. It is the least academic options textbook I’ve come across; I’m not even sure if it identifies as a textbook...</p>
<p>Maymin encourages readers to develop heuristics and intuition, hacking together quick simulations instead of mucking about with stochastic calculus. This emphasis on experimentation is one of the areas where the book stands out; rather than just presenting simulation results, Maymin explains how to set up simulations, identifying some of the common errors and good practices. Having spent hours trying to build and debug such scripts, I wish I had been told this before.</p>
<p>Technical explanations are given in plain English, and the book is packed with little financial puzzles that memorably elucidate the concepts at hand; some of these puzzles address questions that took me a long time to build an intuition for (like why we can’t always sell skew), others address questions I had never thought to ask (for example the fact that stocks are actually forwards due T+2 settlement).</p>
<p>Regarding where this book fits in with other volatility resources, <em>Financial Hacking</em> discusses similar content to that in Sinclair’s <a href="/?books=volatility-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Volatility Trading</a>, but it is more “interactive” due to the puzzles and step-by-step explanations. Part 3 of the book covers exotic options: though this isn’t particularly relevant to me, it’s a good illustration of the financial hacker’s approach – rather than trying to analytically price some complex derivative, we can use intuition to get a rough sense of the risks. <a href="/?books=the-derivatives-academy" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Derivatives Academy</a> is a nice next step for people who want to move beyond pure “hacking” into the pricing of exotics, without completely sacrificing intuition.</p>
<p>I enjoyed <em>Financial Hacking</em> immensely and would be comfortable recommending it (possibly excluding Part 3) as one of the first books one should read on a derivatives trading desk. I end this review with Maymin’s financial hacking manifesto:</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>“Finance is the study of risk, even though risk does not have a perfect decision”.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How is it pronounced? Is it fin-ANCE or FINE-ance? (a) It is pronounced FINE-ance when it is a verb, as in, “I want to finance this vehicle,” but fin-ANCE when it is a noun, as in, “I work in finance.” (b) The exact opposite is true. (c) Neither of the above is true. The answer seems to be (a) in the U.S.A. and (b) in the U.K., so globally the answer must be (c). I don&#39;t think anybody knows. Pronounce it however you like, in any context.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Quantum physicist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr once said, essentially, that the opposite of a true statement is obviously false, but the opposite of a profound truth is another profound truth. The existence of arbitrage opportunities is a profound truth. Arbitrage is simultaneously both impossible and prevalent. Bohr argued that only in allowing and confronting the paradox head-on can we grow in our understanding. “How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.” Niels Bohr</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Accumulate risks that are hateful to others; dispose of risks that are hateful to you. That is the whole of financial hacking; the rest is commentary. Now go and trade.”</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi-technical lecture series on the qualia of scientific research]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em> is a lecture series from the great Richard Hamming on the qualia of scientific research and progress. This is clearly something that Hamming is more than qualified to speak on – during his time at Bell Labs, he was a pioneer of coding theory and several of his inventions, like Hamming codes, underly much of our modern communication technology.</p>
<p>The lectures were addressed to graduate engineering students; this makes much of the book somewhat inaccessible for those lacking STEM training. The other side of this coin is that the book provides a nice high-level-but-somewhat-technical introduction to coding theory and signal processing, which is an under appreciated and unexpectedly fascinating area.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think that the last few chapters are a valuable read for anyone whose job involves research (which should be true for most knowledge workers!). Hamming addresses difficult topics like creativity, experts, and research organisations with adroit wisdom.</p>

<p>I often suspect creativity is like sex; a young lad can read all the books you have on the topic, but without direct experience he will have little chance of understanding what sex is—but even with experience he may still not understand what is going on</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The false starts and false solutions often sharpen the next approach you try</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Experts</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>An expert is one who knows everything about nothing; A generalist knows nothing about everything.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I have covered the two main problems of dealing with the experts. They are: (1) the expert is certain they are right, and (2) they do not consider the basis for their beliefs and the extent to which they apply to new situations</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Greatness</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>I strongly recommend this taking the time, on a regular basis, to ask the larger questions and not stay immersed in the sea of detail where almost every one stays almost all of the time.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is another trait of great people I must talk about—and it took me a long time to realize it. Great people can tolerate ambiguity, they can both believe and disbelieve at the same time.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Most great people also have 10 to 20 problems they regard as basic and of great importance, and which they currently do not know how to solve. They keep them in their mind, hoping to get a clue as to how to solve them. When a clue does appear they generally drop other things and get to work immediately on the important problem</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zoological travelogue with Adams’ biting wit]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Last Chance to See</em>, Douglas Adams and his zoologist companion Mark Cawardine travel around the world to shed light on several critically endangered species – those species that might not be around in a few years, hence the title of the book.</p>
<p>Zoology was one of my early interests – as a child, I was addicted to Animal Planet and could quote endless animal trivia. I lost this interest as I grew up, but <em>Last Chance to See</em> revived (at least briefly) the same childish wonder I had at the remarkable diversity of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>The book is blisteringly funny, dripping with the same dry humour and mastery of the English language that makes the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide</em> such a joy to read. Amidst the rather poignant discussion of species with fewer than 100 surviving members, we get an incredibly amusing look into international travel before globalisation kicked off, though one must excuse what would now be called “ignorance” (or worse!) on the author’s part.</p>
<p>But beneath this humour is a harrowing tale of unique species struggling against extinction – one often feels that Adams’ wit is a defence mechanism against the deep sadness of the situation. The book simultaneously evokes disgust at humanity’s callous disregard for exotic forms of life (including the senseless hunt of the dodo for no reason other than idle amusement), and hope inspired by the few who are fighting so desperately for preservation. Their stories are worth hearing.</p>

<p>[Watching a Komodo dragon eat a lamb] Maybe it was the feeling of cold unflinching arrogance that so disturbed us. But whatever malign emotions we tried to pin on to the lizard, we knew that they weren&#39;t the lizard&#39;s emotions at all, only ours. The lizard was simply going about its lizardly business in a simple, straightforward lizardly way. It didn&#39;t know anything about the horror, the guilt, the shame, the ugliness that we, uniquely guilty and ashamed animals, were trying to foist on it. So we got it all straight back at us, as if reflected in the mirror of its single unwavering and disinterested eye. Subdued with the thought that we had somehow been horrified by our own reflection, we sat quietly and waited for lunch. (loc 435)</p>

<p>Certainly the dizzy experience of vertigo seems to have far more in common with feelings of oscillating mental conflict and confusion than it does with simple fear. If it is a fear, it&#39;s one we love to play with and tease ourselves with, which is how designers of big dippers and Ferris wheels make a living. The feeling I had looking at my first silverback gorilla in the wild was vertiginous. It was as if there was something I was meant to do, some reaction that was expected of me, and I didn&#39;t know what it was or how to do it. My modern mind was simply saying, `Run away!&#39; but all I could do was stand, trembling, and stare. (loc 950)</p>

<p>Sadly, however, it seems that not only has the kakapo forgotten how to fly, but it has also forgotten that it has forgotten how to fly.

<p>[On the Yangtze river dolphin, which “sees” purely through echolocation] As I watched the wind ruffling over the bilious surface of the Yangtze I realised with the vividness of shock, that somewhere beneath or around me there were intelligent animals whose perceptive universe we could scarcely begin to imagine, living in a seething, poisoned, deafening world, and that their lives were probably passed in continual bewilderment, hunger, pain and fear.

<p>The term `fed up&#39; actually comes from falconry.</p>
<p>When you train a falcon you train it by hunger, using it as a tool to manipulate the bird&#39;s psychology. So when the bird has had too much to eat it won&#39;t co-operate and gets annoyed by any attempts to tell it what to do. It simply sits in the top of a tree and sulks. It is `fed up&#39;.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People care about relative risk, not absolute risk. The CAPM is wrong!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instead of <em>Finding Alpha</em> , Falkenstein’s book ought to be called <em>Killing Beta</em> . The central tenet of the book is that more risk <em>does not</em> beget more return. Specifically, Falkenstein argues that the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and its intellectual descendants – Arbitrage Pricing Theory and the Stochastic Discount Factor – are wrong. Not incomplete, but simply <em>wrong</em> . Needless to say, this flies in the face of most of financial academia, though many of the ideas have now gained acceptance among practitioners.</p>
<p>Falkenstein traces the history of the CAPM, outlining the intellectual milieu that produced it (the “Physics envy” of post-Samuelson economics) and the early empirical results that seemed to support it. Having trained under some of the finest financial economists of his generation, Falkenstein can hardly be accused of misunderstanding the subject matter; his explanations and derivations of the CAPM and APT are first-rate. He takes a highly methodical approach to analyse the assumptions on which these theories rest, then, with a Feynman quote as a North star, he proceeds to dismantle the CAPM: “It doesn&#39;t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn&#39;t matter how smart you are. If it doesn&#39;t agree with experiment, it&#39;s wrong”.</p>
<p>What distinguishes Falkenstein’s critique from other anti-establishment thinkers (such as the Mandelbrots and Talebs of the world) is that he provides a competing theory – in the words of Andrew Lo, “it takes a theory to beat a theory”. His core postulate is that investors care not about absolute risk, but <em>relative</em> risk; the nightmare scenario for an investor is to lose money <em>while their neighbour is making money</em> . With this one simple statement, which seems at least as plausible as the “absolute concave utility” assumption of the CAPM, risk premia evaporate, and beta along with it. As with Einstein’s relativity, from a simple new postulate springs a theory which explains the facts better than the current paradigm.</p>
<p><em>Finding Alpha</em> is an intellectual treat and an excellent antidote to academic dogma (not just financial). Falkenstein meanders widely through epistemology, the history of science, and his own personal experiences of academia. This perhaps makes the book tough to recommend to a specific audience. But if we adopt an information theory mindset, information is really a measure of <em>surprise</em> – unexpectedness relative to the prior distribution. In that regard, <em>Finding Alpha</em> is a deeply informative gem that seems to have received far less attention than it deserves.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The CAPM is a theory that makes specific testable predictions; the APT is a framework that generates theories.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Empirical observations contradict the CAPM and its derivatives:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">&quot;Higher risk higher return&quot; is generally NOT true.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Volatility and expected return are mostly unrelated, but both super-safe and super-risky assets have a lower expected return</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Core thesis:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">People benchmark against consensus, so the market portfolio is risk-free. Any deviation from consensus must be matched by an opposite deviation, and both are equally risky relative to the market portfolio. It cannot be that both have positive expected value, so expected return is not generally related to risk.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">We overpay for the safest assets, so they have negative EV</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Risk-taking is based on hope, and thus has negative EV</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A photorealistic portrait of high finance from the front lines]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Fed Up</em> is a photorealistic portrait of high finance – from an author who is literally at the top of the business, having run the macro units at Citadel and Balyasny. The book is a stream of consciousness account of Lancaster’s life in 2020, mixing technical observations of the economy and thoughts on trading with reflections on both the minor stresses of day to day life and the major stresses of running a large portfolio. Lancaster speaks plainly about what he sees in the markets, what he thinks distinguishes the great from the mediocre, and conveys deep battle-hardened wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Fed Up</em> is brutally, uncomfortably, delightfully honest. Lancaster doesn’t try to hide away the less pleasant aspects of his life: marriage troubles, having to fire someone, waking up in the middle of the night with a “PnL dream”. This is what makes the book a must-read for anyone who aspires to be a “Master of the Universe” – it could indeed be a life of extravagance, intellectual stimulation, and agency, but it is a business that puts considerable strain on personal relationships.</p>
<p>I don’t suppose the book will be of much interest to people outside of the particular niche of hedge funds and prop trading – but if you want to understand the qualia of being a material risk taker, there is no better book. <em>Fed Up</em> is an unparalleled insight into the life – in all of its richness and tumult, the ups and the downs – of an industry-leader. I guess this is one consequence of COVID that we can be grateful for: many people who would not otherwise write books because they are too busy playing at the top of their game found time to share their wisdom.</p>

<p>The Holy Grail of macro is finding an imbalance. Maybe it’s related to growth, or interest rates, or a central bank’s reaction function, and then profiting from the moves in that country’s interest rates, or foreign exchange, or equity, or credit markets. (loc 103)</p>

<p>For many macro investors, it can be boiled down to a simple sentence: What will the future state of the world look like and what is already priced by the markets? We do an amazing amount of work to try to answer this question. When we find an outlier, something that’s not priced by the markets, we get excited. (loc 1578)</p>

<p>The best macro managers tend to change their minds a lot. When they do, they need to know they can get out of what they have. (loc 111)</p>

<p>the guys at the top are all trained assassins. No more time to be all coked up at Studio 54. They have trainers, psychologists, meditation coaches, anything to increase their edge. And they all have another trait in common. They’re paranoid about failure, paranoid it will all go away, and they don’t have enough. (loc 339)</p>

<p>The greats in our business perform at a different level, like Michael Jordan hitting that jump shot. Everything is in slow motion for them. It’s part IQ, part experience, part intuition. It’s understanding correlations and seeing patterns form before others do, having an uncanny sense of when the markets don’t feel right. They can tell when someone knows more than they do, and pivot.</p>
<p>They also understand the fear and greed cycle of the markets and the dynamics of crowd mentality, the ability to get out of harm’s way, to admit they’re wrong and cut bait quickly. They’re frequently wrong but rarely lose money. They do this by structuring their trades in smart ways, by setting loss limits, and by making more money when they’re right than they lose when they’re wrong. They’re incredible at protecting downside, incredible at managing risk.</p>
<p>They never rest on their success, never pat themselves on the back. They only remember their fuckups. And they’re always looking forward, always trying to predict the future. They’re not stuck in the here and now and don’t let a temporary crisis turn into ruin. They turn defeats into a challenge so they can make better decisions in the future. And all of this translates into knowing when to bet big, when to get to max size. This is a rare skill and takes incredible amounts of self-confidence. (loc 624)</p>

<p>To me, the best traders are exceptional decision makers. They’re intensely competitive. They don’t let emotions affect their process. They’re not into excessive risk taking; they’re into smart risk taking. More than anything, they love finding a divergent view that’s not priced by the markets. To be a great trader, you need to know yourself. You need to develop a type of multidimensional self-awareness. You need to understand what motivates you, how you’ve been impacted by past events, where you sit on the risk-taking spectrum, what type of decision maker you are, what key blockers are holding you back from peak performance, and how you can create an environment for yourself for optimal performance. And then, you need to constantly improve and get better. And this is all after you’ve spent your 10,000 hours becoming a market expert and honing an investment process or strategy that produces reliable results and is embedded within a prudent risk framework. (loc 2607)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Spend the time to develop the technical proficiency required to master the markets. This is your price of entry, your 10,000 hours. Construct your own investment process, prove to yourself that it works, and then embed it in a risk framework that will allow you to produce the desired return stream. Identify your own motivations, your own core values. It’s something called VBT. Money, power, excitement … or loyalty, creativity, and romance. Know the cognitive biases or impairments that are impairing your decision making, that prevent you from taking good risk. Identify how these items impact your own risk appetite. When are they most likely to seep into your thoughts and impair your ability to succeed? Create that optimal routine that puts you in the right environment and right state of mind to be a top performer: keeping fit, eating well, staying balanced. It can even be little things. Maybe it’s a lucky sweater on days you get payrolls. And then, once you’ve done all of this, if you really want to be a master of the universe, you need to develop an entirely new set of skills. You need to learn how to scale and how to build a great business and great teams. Selecting team members, managing them, getting the right mix of skill sets and technical abilities. All of this means less time trading and more time managing. (loc 2632)</p>

<p>When a market crash like the one in 2008 happens, there’s no way to prepare. If you’re long risk assets, you get slammed. Nothing is bulletproof. There’s no way to describe how bad it feels. There is no way to react. It’s all too late. (loc 367)</p>

<p>Markets like this try to shred you alive. They take no prisoners. They try to do as much damage as possible. A lot of people don’t make it out. When stocks are moving up or down 5% a day, VIX is above fifty, and bonds are triggering a VaR warning every ten minutes, this is not the time to try to be a hero. You don’t try to make money in periods like this. It’s too late to hedge. Liquidity is gone. You do your damnedest to fucking just stay alive, maintain fewer positions, figure out where the pain is. Trade small so you can widen stops. Don’t get cute. Don’t try to be a hero. (loc 2463)</p>

What does she mean, ‘We are not here to close spreads?’ Are you fucking serious? That’s your only job right now. Markets won’t like this. We need to start selling more. Hurry. What was she thinking? What the fuck is LaGarde doing? Doesn’t she realize that they have no choice. Fucking amateur hour.” I jump in. “E, he’s right. Hit more bids.” (loc 2531)</p>

<p>In this business, you can never panic. You always need to have a plan. When the markets are going gonzo, I like to get back to basics. I read my old daily trading journals to see how I reacted in past periods, what mistakes I made. It’s all good process. At the end of the day, it’s all about assessing probabilities. We all play probabilities. There are no sure things. (loc 2578)</p>

<p>Early in my career, I learned a good lesson from my boss. There was a skirmish in the Middle East and crude was moving higher. I was worried about our risk and how the markets would react.

<p>You have to have discipline in this business. Set stops on every position. Find the good 5:1 payouts, with multiple ways to win. They’re the ones you need in your book. One of my early bosses taught me that. He used to ask me the same questions every day on every position in our book. I thought it was insanity. But then I realized he was just testing my conviction, looking for any indication that my answer might be changing, even just a little bit. In the early days, it drove me crazy. Now, I think the best risk takers would be crazy not to do it. (loc 1941)</p>

<p>President Nixon killed the Bretton Woods Agreement and then a guy named Paul Volcker had to clean up the mess. The net result was that all major currencies began to float against each other. This really opened things up for the global macro guys. Overnight, you had an amazing number of new products to trade. (loc 119)</p>

<p>“Growth in a Time of Debt,” also known by its authors’ names as Reinhart–Rogoff, is an economics paper by American economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. The paper argues that when “gross external debt reaches 60% of GDP,” a country’s annual growth declines by 2%, and “for levels of external debt in excess of 90%,” GDP growth is “roughly cut in half.” Appearing in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the evidence for the 90% debt threshold hypothesis provided support for pro-austerity policies.

<p>Paul Volcker, He was chairman of the Fed under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan from ‘79 to ‘87, back when you could work for both a Democratic and Republican boss. It was a messy time. America was dealing with oil shocks, the fallout from the Vietnam War, the end of the Bretton Woods system, and then massive tax cuts. Volcker made a huge bet to fight inflation. He didn’t just hike rates; he fucking ran them as high as he could—to over 20%. This tanked the economy in the early ‘80s, and unemployment skyrocketed, but it beat inflation. (loc 1372)</p>
<p>They called Alan Greenspan the maestro. Lower for Longer seemed like a good plan, a way to keep the juice flowing. And when Lower for Longer didn’t work, he invented the Fed put to give people confidence to buy the dip. (loc 1390)</p>
<p>“The guy that stepped into the mess was Ben Bernanke. He was chair of the Fed from 2006 to 2014. They call him Helicopter Ben. Folks were happy with Bernanke being in the seat because he had written his thesis on the Great Depression. He didn’t think the Fed did enough back then, and he was not going to make the same mistake. He had also done that other research on Japan’s bubble and thought QE was a good idea for the Japanese.” (loc 1422)</p>
<p>“Then it was Janet Yellen’s turn. She was chair of the Fed from 2014 to 2018. She also bought into the great moderation propaganda. She defended QE and kept it on autopilot but always said you couldn’t do it forever. You had to revert back to normal policy. (loc 1426)</p>
<p>“Now we have Jay. Jerome Powell, polysci from Princeton and law degree from Georgetown. He was nominated by the Big D. He’s all-in on QE. He won’t have a choice. He’ll be known as the guy who created an even bigger bubble. His bubble will put Greenspan’s to shame. He can’t afford a recession and will need to create wealth inequality on an epic scale. Investors have already bid stocks to all-time highs. (loc 1438)</p>

<p>I’m going to end my journal here. I began writing with hopes of capturing a moment in time, a watershed event that can be parsed and memorialized when the system finally collapses under its own self-congratulating weight, when the saviors of the world are unable to save, and when their flocks finally see them for what they are, and reality for what it is. It just hasn’t turned out that way. Instead, thirty-three million people are unemployed, civil unrest is in the streets, the gap between rich and poor is wider than ever, and the markets are back at their highs. It has turned into one of the greatest wealth transfers of all time. But these are not my problems. As I told you early on, my job is to turn a pile of money into a bigger pile of money. I’ve done that. Knowing how the game is played, I’ve called it right, just as I did during the last crisis, and just as I’ll do during the next crisis. I’m back on top. I got into this business hoping to be a man of his time. I was then. And I am now. (loc 3858)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Art of Short Selling</em> is a mix between a manifesto and a practical guide. Written at a time when short selling was even more of a taboo than it is today, with only a few players brave enough to do the “un-American” thing of actively shorting companies, one can forgive the almost narcissistic battle-hardened tone.</p>
<p>Staley’s book contains a great deal of wisdom, drawing on a wide range of case studies to create a taxonomy for short candidates. <em>The Art of Short Selling</em> is not for the faint of heart – the majority of the book is turn-by-turn case studies of some trades (including analysis of the financial statements), which are helpful if you&#39;re willing to spend time grappling with the accounting technicals, but can also be a little dry. But I personally found it worthwhile to go through these, if only to give context for the nuggets of insight like: “Try to determine if the company is run for the executives or the stockholders”.</p>
<p>This is an important read for anyone interested in long/short equity, and it’s perhaps unsurprising that the book is on Point72’s reading list.</p>

<p>Short selling is a game of wits, with the odds in favor of the analysts who do hard work and think for themselves, who turn jaundiced eyes on what passes for Wall Street wisdom. (loc 398)</p>

<p>He [Chanos] feels that part of the satisfaction of short selling is going against Wall Street. Corporate management is rarely the target, unless there is fraud. It is generally Wall Street that has engineered the ascent of the stock. (loc 571)</p>

<p>Chanos maintains a concentrated portfolio of about 30 stocks, with 10 positions accounting for more than 50 percent of his portfolio. Typically, he likes to short stocks with secular problems where he can make a &quot;reasonably strong argument, based on the valuation of the business (much like the private market players look for discount to value), that the equity value of the enterprise is $0.

<p>From the short point of view, the most important decision on a concept stock is: Does this work - is the prospective return worth the risk for the stockholder? The second question is: How soon will the new company run out of money? Shorts almost always judge correctly if the business is dying. On the timing of the demise, they are seldom right. Someone is usually available to buy stock, loan money, offer shortterm bank debt long after the company financials are in nearly terminal condition. Add two years to a short&#39;s best projection, and you might only have a couple more years to wait. (loc 931)</p>

<p>When a company switches or expands its business line into something completely different, it generally means management fears that growth will slow in the main line. When they expand into a highly competitive business that costs money for product development (like software game titles) when the base business eats money as well, you sit back and watch with relish for the train wreck to happen sooner.

<p>The simplest form of financial obfuscation is detected by tracking the growth in receivables versus the growth in sales. Outsized growth leads the analyst to search out policies on booking revenues and collecting cash. (loc 1582)</p>

<p>During a time of prosperity and economic expansion, the companies that cannot earn a respectable living are left no recourse but to sell out or restructure if the level of the stock price aggravates shareholders or if a raider notes the underlying assets. Three categories of opportunity appear in a bull market: (1) the restructured and heavily indebted company close to a stumble (2) the &quot;for sale&quot; but not sold company (3) the company with deteriorating earnings that attempts to create the appearance of health with sale of assets.

<p>When a major, industry-wrenching change occurs, money can be made by taking a position in a group of stocks clustered around a theme. Massive industry change can be triggered by macroeconomic events, by a specific product revolution, or by the death of a fad. (loc 2516)</p>

<p>Texas taught investors that when a region and its economy are built on growth, a slowing rate of change in the growth engine can pull the whole structure to the ground. A dropping real estate market takes the economy with it, including commercial loans and basic bank business. (loc 2536)</p>

<p>Consistency in management style is one attribute that cheers short sellers. Most corporate managers reproduce the errors of the past with remarkably regular frequency and inspire their corporate culture with the same consistency of mismanagement. (loc 1351)</p>

<p>Longtime short wisdom (if there was such a thing in 1993, after the trying years that went before) says to short a stock when the Wal-Mart pipeline is full. Pipeline fill refers to the process of filling the distribution channels&#39; inventories: If the product is sold to the consumer from stores, the manufacturer must produce and deliver the product to every available store outlet. Pipeline fill on a new product rollout gathers momentum as more and more &quot;doors&quot; are opened; sales momentum crescendos as bigger and bigger accounts are added. At some point, the pipeline is full-every store has a shelf of product, and the growth rate is purely what the consumer consumes. So the revenue or top-line growth rate drops from huge to high teens or, even worse, single digits. That is the death of a growth stock. Thus, when Wal-Mart is full, the product is pretty much at the top of the growth curve.

<p>the &quot;other asset&quot; category on the balance sheet was large relative to pretax earnings.

<p>The bigger point on cash appetite in a growth company is a concept called sustainable growth rate. It is an easy thing to remember and a killer ratio to track. Sustainable growth rate says that a company can grow at the rate of return on equity times the retention rate without going to the capital markets. The return on equity (ROE) is pure and simple: net income divided by equity on the balance sheet. In this case, 1992 net income was $3.2 million, equity was $56.4 million. The retention rate is the percentage of net income that the company does not pay out in a dividend. (loc 1494)</p>

<p>A short lecture on cash flow is in order: Cash flow is defined as &quot;net income plus depreciation, amortization, and deferred taxes.&quot; Cash flow from operations generally takes into account working capital as well. An analyst wants to know how much cash is available to the company for expansion, dividends, stock purchase, or retirement of debt-in other words, what is the financial flexibility of the company? That means making subjective decisions about the business of the company and what cash flows relate directly to that business. Some examples are: (1) a furniture-rental company must continually refurbish rental furniture or revenues slow; so the analyst tempers the depreciation add-back number to take this into account because depreciation is a direct cost of doing business; (2) when analyzing retailers, adjustments must be made for inventory and receivables because they have to have inventory to sell; (3) when analyzing a cable production company, produced programming is surely a cost of staying in business. End of lecture. (loc 2083)</p>

<p>The most important lesson from Integrated, one that should have been obvious (but perhaps not in the 1980s), was that banks and other short-term lenders (Drexel, in this case) control the destiny of a company that has negative cash flow.

Assets might be undervalued on the balance sheet, but if a company&#39;s particular asset (be it a buggy whip or real estate) is illiquid when it needs funds, the asset does not count for much except as collateral for bonds or bank loans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What makes someone willing to play Russian Roulette for their country? The Right Stuff.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Right Stuff</em> is a study of risk-taking, pride, and peak performance. What makes some people willing to take obscene risks? Wolfe explores this through the lens of a certain breed of American heroes: the naval aviators who participated in the manned space programme.</p>
<p>These men were proud Americans, but patriotism is not the answer. They were military men, but duty alone could not explain such risk taking. Instead, those with the ineffable right stuff played Russian roulette for the <em>sake</em> of risk-taking, seeking peak performance partially as an end in itself, and partially for the respect and admiration of other people with the right stuff.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but draw the parallels to big risk-takers in finance: those pilots with the right stuff seem to be cut from the same cloth as the “Masters of the Universe” that young financiers often aspire to be – indeed, it was Wolfe who coined this phrase 10 years later in <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em>, though perhaps Michael Lewis’ “big swinging dick” captures the idea more appropriately. Anyone starting a hedge fund knows that the odds are severely stacked against them, yet they do it nevertheless: “The figures were averages, and averages applied to those with average stuff“.</p>
<p><em>The Right Stuff</em> is a “non-fiction novel” in the tradition of Capote’s <em>In Cold Blood.</em> I’m not a particularly experienced reader of this genre, but after reading this, I’m convinced history would be much more interesting if it were recounted by Wolfe!</p>

<p>As late as 1970,I was to discover in an article by a military doctor in a medical journal a career Navy pilot faced a 23 percent likelihood of dying in an accident. This did not even include deaths in combat, which at that time, with the war in Vietnam in progress, were catastrophically high for Navy pilots. The Right Stuff became the story of why men were willing—willing?—delighted!—to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero.

<p>in this fraternity, even though it was military, men were not rated by their outward rank as ensigns, lieutenants, commanders, or whatever. No, herein the world was divided into those who had it and those who did not. This quality, this it, was never named, however, nor was it talked about in any way. (loc 320)</p>

<p>One fine day, after he had joined a fighter squadron, it would dawn on the young pilot exactly how the losers in the great fraternal competition were now being left behind. Which is to say, not by instructors or other superiors or by failures at prescribed levels of competence, but by death. At this point the essence of the enterprise would begin to dawn on him. Slowly, step by step, the ante had been raised until he was now involved in what was surely the grimmest and grandest gamble of manhood. (loc 443)</p>

<p>The real problem was that reporters violated the invisible walls of the fraternity. They blurted out questions and spoke boorish words about… all the unspoken things!—about fear and bravery (they would say the words!) and how you felt at such-and-such a moment! It was obscene! They presumed a knowledge and an intimacy they did not have and had no right to. (loc 840)</p>

<p>In time, the Navy would compile statistics showing that for a career Navy pilot, i.e., one who intended to keep flying for twenty years as Conrad did, there was a 23 percent probability that he would die in an aircraft accident. This did not even include combat deaths, since the military did not classify death in combat as accidental. Furthermore, there was a better than even chance, a 56 percent probability, to be exact, that at some point a career Navy pilot would have to eject from his aircraft and attempt to come down by parachute.

He sits there in the classes staring at sheets of paper with cataracts of sheer human mortification over his eyes while the rest steal looks at him… this man reduced to an ant, this untouchable, this poor sonofabitch.

<p>Part of this outpouring of emotion and attention was the simple response of a grateful people to men who were willing to risk their lives to protect them. But there was also a certain calculation behind it. The steady pressure of fame and honor tended to embolden the lads still further by constantly reminding them that the fate of the entire people was involved in their performance in battle. At the same time—and this was no small thing in such a high-risk occupation—the honor and glory were in many cases rewards before the fact; on account, as it were. (loc 1660)</p>

<p>people throughout the world looked upon the competition in launching space vehicles in that fashion, i.e., as a preliminary contest proving final and irresistible power to destroy. The ability to launch Sputniks dramatized the ability to launch nuclear warheads on ICBMs. But in these neo-superstitious times it came to dramatize much more than that. It dramatized the entire technological and intellectual capability of the two nations and the strength of the national wills and spirits. (loc 1673)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constraints are neither optional nor subject to preferences]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Geopolitics has always been a fascinating mystery to me. It is a deeply complex multi-faceted game theory problem and there isn’t an obvious level of abstraction to use to understand the system: countries are run by individuals, who have decision functions that may not align with the sovereign entity they represent. For instance, Papic points out that during the Brexit negotiations in 2019, Boris Johnson was playing a three-level game: unifying Tory infighting, securing Tory leadership over Labour, and strengthening (or damage-controlling) Britain’s standing in the world; only by understanding the interactions between these three levels could an analyst make an accurate forecast of the Brexit negotiations.</p>
<p>This complexity often can be confused for arbitrary subjective behaviour, for example, Trump’s “petulance” in the trade war and Putin’s imperialism. Papic rejects this (or at least, diminishes the relevance of these preferences). The core thesis of the book is that we should not be trying to understand the <em>preferences</em> of geopolitical agents, we should be trying to understand their <em>constraints</em> . Papic summarises his Constraints Framework thus: **“**Preferences are optional and subject to constraints; constraints are neither optional nor subject to preferences”.</p>
<p><em>Geopolitical Alpha</em> explores several such constraints and uses case studies to illustrate how these constraints end up driving reality more so than individual preferences. The case studies are not clear-cut ex-post narratives: Papic aims to convey the full nuance of the concept instantiations, which happens to be in line with some modern research on optimally learning in ill-structured domains (Cognitive Flexibility Theory – see Cedric Chin’s explanation <a href="https://commoncog.com/how-note-taking-can-help-you-become-an-expert/">here</a>). Unsurprisingly, the book has a strong practical bent – it is titled <em>Geopolitical Alpha</em> rather than <em>Geopolitical Analysis</em> for a reason. Papic’s focus is primarily on how we can understand geopolitical situations with a view to making investment decisions, taking into account the uncertainty of a situation and market positioning. Papic is quick to point out that his framework is descriptive rather than normative – he only wants to know what the world <em>is</em>, rather than what it should be, and advocates that would-be geopolitical analysts adopt a “professional nihilism”.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend the book. In addition to being highly information-dense, the book is an engaging read, amplified by Papic’s dry-bordering-dark sense of humour. While I don’t think I’ll be ready to start making bold geopolitical calls any time soon, <em>Geopolitical Alpha</em> has given me a whetstone to begin sharpening my probability distributions of geopolitical events.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An excellent opinionated guide on practical statistical modelling]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An excellent practical introduction to all things regression-related. Harrell’s book will not tell you about the Gauss-Markov assumptions and the asymptotic properties of estimators. Instead, it is an opinionated guide to the realities of statistical modelling.</p>
<p>The introduction chapter addresses important meta-questions about the importance of models and things to consider before modelling. Chapter 2 gives a good overview of how to interpret and evaluate regression models, while providing a comparison with other model formulations like decision trees and ML. Chapter 4 provides several strategies for multivariate modelling; Chapter 5 suggests some very interesting techniques for validating models.</p>
<p>I derived a lot of value from the book. It contains a large toolbox of statistical techniques and it’s full of rules of thumb that academic statisticians are often loath to provide: for example, you need at least 15 data points per predictor.</p>
<p>I skimmed over some parts of the book as they aren’t relevant to me at the moment: survival analysis, logistic regression, longitudinal response. But I’m comfortable in the knowledge that I can flick back to those chapters when and if.</p>
<p>This is a selection of advice that resonates with me:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Prefer regression over classification. It allows you to separate the decision function from the actual model.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Random methods:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Add noise to y variables before doing feature selection to avoid overfitting.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Apply your pipeline to the same dataset with shuffled y (no signal). If you still get a fit, you have overfit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Be careful “spending” degrees of freedom by e.g. looking at scatter plots before regressing.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Avoid stepwise feature selection</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An astounding fugue on self-reference and heterarchies]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>GEB</em> is a work of art. Extraordinarily playful, with countless hidden puzzles, <em>GEB</em> is a fugue on the idea of self-reference, braiding together three strands: mathematics (Gödel), art (Escher), and music (Bach). But rather than being ends in themselves, the strands provide a language to explore the deeper concepts of strange loops and heterarchies, which Hofstadter believes can shed light on the truly difficult questions of consciousness and AI.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, I like to try and reduce a book to its core ideas and insights. But it feels profoundly wrong to try and do that for <em>GEB</em> , given that one of the recurring motifs is anti-reductionism, the idea that some systems simply cannot be understood on a lower level of abstraction. Gödel incompleteness is one of the prominent examples of this: there are true statements about number theory that cannot be expressed within number theory.</p>
<p>Doug Hofstadter has a remarkable command of many different fields, which he synthesises together beautifully in <em>GEB</em> . On my first read several years ago, I was most intrigued by the Typographical Number Theory, a minimal number theory (isomorphic to Peano arithmetic) that he uses to clearly explain Gödel incompleteness. But on this read, I was more drawn to his explanation of molecular genetics: the remarkable way that DNA codes for proteins that process the DNA. I think the crowning achievement of the book is the “Central Dogmap”(a pun on Crick’s Central Dogma of Molecular biology – “DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein”), which provides an astounding mapping between molecular biology and mathematical logic and by extension, computer programming and AI.</p>
<p>Each section of the book starts with an Alice-in-Wonderland-esque discussion between Achilles and Tortoise (and some other minor recurring characters like Crab). These little discussions initially seem innocuous but they are actually astounding intellectual achievements, each acting as a representation of the next chapters of the book on a different level of abstraction: one of them, titled Crab Canon, is a Crab Canon – it reads almost the same in reverse. The final Six-Part-Ricercar mimics Bach’s six-part fugue in the Musical Offering with a high level of fidelity. Also, do you notice anything special in the names Achilles, Tortoise, Crab, and Gödel…</p>
<p>Like the Madeleine biscuits did for Proust, this re-read has evoked wandering (and mostly joyful) memories. I first read <em>GEB</em> shortly after finishing high school and was utterly enthralled by the playful intellectual nature of the book. Not much has changed on this re-read. The book is full of hidden acrostics, self-reference, and subtle humour that I missed the first time, leaving me with a childish grin. I realised just how many things went over my head, and I expect many things will have gone over my head this time round. But that’s a good thing, because I know that the next time I re-read it, perhaps jaded with more years of adult life, I will find that childlike joy once more.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Forgive me for the weird diction at the start of each paragraph. It is not without purpose</em></p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Enzymes play the role of both data and program – there is a strange loop. Just like in Gödel Incompleteness where statements about number theory are represented in number theory.</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each culture has its own approach to data]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Modelling Mindsets</em> is a wonderful book that places the spotlight on a seldom-discussed aspect of data science: it is not a book about how to do modelling, rather, it is about meta-modelling, introducing and contrasting the various approaches to data science.</p>
<p>In any data science problem, whether you realise it or not, you are implicitly using a modelling mindset (Frequentism, Bayesianism, Causal inference, Machine Learning). This book explains the philosophical assumptions used by each mindset and contrasts their applications. The ideal audience of this book is a reader with some experience in applied statistics – perhaps a physicist who has had to run some regressions, a product manager who has done some A/B testing, or a trader attempting to quantify the distribution of returns surrounding a trade – who may not even be aware that they are subscribing to a particular mindset.</p>
<p>I first got interested in data science via machine learning – like many other naive kiddos, I was attracted by glitzy random forests and SVMs and uninterested in boring classical statistics. It has taken me many years of trying different approaches to attain a fraction of the wisdom that Molnar lucidly conveys. While <em>Modelling Mindsets</em> is impractical in the sense that it does not teach you how to apply any of the mindsets, it is highly practical in the sense that it helps you reason about which approach to use for a certain problem. It’s pitched at an ideal level of abstraction, condensing entire fields of academic literature into several sentences explaining the purpose and context for a particular approach, if not the how-tos.</p>
<p><em>Modelling Mindsets</em> is an excellent tour of the toolbox for data science and an important read if you want to be someone who uses the right tool for the job.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oil refining is a hugely important aspect of the modern world that we seldom think about. Before reading this, all I knew about oil refining came from GCSE chemistry, which hardly does justice to the remarkable complexity of it all. Instead of the simple fractional distillation we were pitched in school, refineries are marvels of chemical engineering, with hundreds of interconnected processing units all designed to process crude oils (all the different grades and specs) into usable products like petrol, diesel, and plastics.</p>
<p><em>Petroleum Refining in Nontechnical Language</em> is a reasonably accessible textbook with a distinct sense of humour that brings light to what would normally be a dry overview of oil chemistry and industrial engineering. Even though I was primarily interested in the book from the perspective of the financial market for petroleum products (of which little is discussed), a basic understanding of the chemistry is a prerequisite.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Derivatives Academy</em> is an <a href="https://bookdown.org/maxime_debellefroid/MyBook/">online textbook</a> on derivatives and structured products. I had low expectations – the book is associated with a training course run by the author – but it’s actually rather good.</p>
<p>The book is written by a practitioner and for a practitioner: even for some of the more exotic products (whose chapters, I confess I skimmed), de Bellefroid focuses on practically relevant matters like hedge ratios rather than the deep stochastic calculus in which other texts bathe.</p>
<p>I found Chapters 1-6 to be at the <em>perfect</em> level of abstraction for an intern or new hire who needs to rapidly understand the meaning of the fancy terms flying between traders. The introduction to volatility surfaces is accessible, quickly striking at important things without getting bogged down in the minutiae of modelling (a welcome contrast to <a href="/?books=the-volatility-surface" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Volatility Surface</a> by Gatheral).</p>
<p><em>The Derivatives Academy</em> helps illuminate the map of complex topics surrounding derivatives, but don’t expect to come out knowing how to fit a Heston model!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are the Laws of the Jungle. Everything else has been competed away.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Laws of Trading</em> is a wonderful book on applied decision-making. Lebron extracts 11 laws from his trading career at Jane Street (one of the sharpest shops out there) and describes their importance for real-world decision-making, for example: the adverse selection that occurs in hiring, the liquidity risk that occurs in gym contracts, and the importance of incentive alignment in workplaces. I really liked an idea from Aaron Brown in the foreword: these “laws” are not laws in the sense of Newton’s Laws, rather they are Laws of the Jungle. They arise because of competition – “everything contrary to them no longer exists”.</p>
<p>The book is deceptively simple – 11 neat laws in plain English – but it is a deliberate simplicity that is evidently the result of deep philosophical thinking from the author, like the simple katana that takes years of expert craftsmanship to forge. There are many layers to each of the ideas. Even for the topics I thought I understood, perhaps <em>especially</em> for those topics, Lebron provided a new looking-glass.</p>
<p>Given that many of the ideas originate from trading, the reader would benefit from some prior interest in finance and trading; perhaps <a href="/?books=the-scout-mindset" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Scout Mindset</a> would be more suitable as a book on general decision-making. That said, I think that it’s often worth putting in the effort to learn enough context so that you can appreciate lessons from experienced practitioners – I am reminded of Atul Gawande’s books, sharing widely-applicable insights based on his time as a surgeon.</p>
<p>My only complaint about <em>The Laws of Trading</em> (and it’s a minor one) is that the structure can be hard to navigate: within the 11 laws, there are plenty of long deviations that seem to have (at least on the surface) little relation to the thrust of the chapter. But this qualm is perhaps unjustified because some of these tangents were the most interesting parts of the book. I particularly enjoyed the insights regarding the sociology of Bell Labs – the organisational factors that made it such a powerhouse of innovation.</p>
<p>There is a reason why plenty of traders highly recommend <em>The Laws of Trading</em> . This is probably a case where it doesn’t pay to be contrarian!</p>

<h3>The Laws</h3>
<p>Paraphrasing Aaron Brown: these laws are Laws of the Jungle, not Newton’s laws: they arise because of competition.</p>
<ol>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Motivation: Know why you are doing a trade before you trade</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Adverse selection: You’re never happy with the amount you traded</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Risk: Take only risks you’re being paid to take. Hedge the others</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Liquidity: Put on risk using the most liquid instrument possible</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Edge: Long term profitability of an edge is inversely proportional to its complexity</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Models: The model expresses the edge</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Costs and capacity: If you think your costs are negligible relative to edge, you&#39;re wrong about at least one of them</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Possibility: Just because something has never happened doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Alignment: Working to align everyone&#39;s interests is time well spent</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Technology: If you don&#39;t master technology and data, you&#39;re losing to someone who does</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Adaptation: If you&#39;re not getting better, you&#39;re getting worse</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eventually persuaded that the title isn’t an oxymoron]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Effective Pandas</em> is an excellent opinionated guide to pandas. “Opinionated” is important in the context of pandas: it’s a very flexible library that gives you rope to hang yourself, often contradicting the zen of Python: “There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it”. This can lead to some very messy code, in which a time-pressed data scientist ends up melding several different programming philosophies just to get their aggregation to work.</p>
<p>No doubt some of the people reading this will consider “effective pandas” to be an oxymoron. That’s reasonable. Pandas seldom feels like it was “designed” in the way that R’s tidyverse is. It is a collection of tricks, wherein fluency only arises from many hours spent pulling one’s hair out.</p>
<p><em>Effective Pandas</em> is Harrison’s effort to define and encourage “idiomatic pandas”, emphasising <strong>chaining</strong>. It just so happens that chaining is the style of pandas that I have converged on due to its readability and elegance. Seeing a nice piece of chained pandas should mellow the complaints of tidyverse folks:</p>
<p>One area that wasn’t properly addressed (which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5) is memory usage and performance. Some of this is quite important, as there are some methods in pandas that create copies of objects but others that modify objects in place.</p>
<p>This aside, <em>Effective Pandas</em> is a useful and readable outline of an important tool; it has the flavour of a user guide rather than a documentation reference. I skimmed through some of the chapters because I’m reasonably familiar with pandas, but I’d recommend the book to anyone who uses pandas a lot.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distressed debt investing from a woman in a male-dominated industry]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Damsel in Distressed</em> is an enjoyable biography. Candid and unapologetic, Mielle takes us through her roller-coaster career in distressed investing (a.k.a. “special situations”), from entry-level analyst to being a partner at a large hedge fund.</p>
<p>In distressed investing, the edge comes from knowing more about a given situation than anybody else – doing deep fundamental research on the underlying business, having a rigorous technical understanding of the various securities related to the situation (few of which are publicly traded!), then combining this with dealmaking, control and leverage. As Matt Levine half-jokingly says, distressed investing is about being part of the 51% of debtholders to take the entire pie, leaving nothing for the other 49%. Few other hedge fund strategies combine fundamentals, technicals, and game theory in quite the same way. Mielle conveys the subjective experience of a distressed investor with lucidity, giving a sprinkling of technical details for the keen reader (e.g. the discussion of equipment trust certificates).</p>
<p>I also enjoyed Mielle’s discussion of the history of the hedge fund industry. She outlines the importance of David Swensen (the late former Chief Investment Officer of the Yale endowment) in catalysing the growth of the HF industry and discusses her experience of the increasing levels of competition – I often hear about this in the abstract, but Mielle examines how it manifests in the day-to-day life of a hedgie.</p>
<p>What makes <em>Damsel</em> unique relative to other books/biographies about investing is Mielle’s discussion of her experiences as a woman in a male-dominated industry. We sometimes like to say that the HF industry is a true meritocracy, not caring about any factors apart from alpha generation. But that’s a broad statement made from a position of privilege; Mielle’s voice is a necessary counterpoint. She blends subjective experience with rigorous evidence, citing studies showing, among other things: women are penalised more harshly for errors, men are more likely to commit misconduct but women are more likely to lose their jobs as a result of misconduct, men take more risk but don’t make more money!</p>
<p><em>Damsel in Distressed</em> is a worthwhile read for anyone in the industry.</p>

<p>When you get on the road, there are two types of meetings. The first are the courtesy visits, meant to update a prospect or an existing client on business and investing conditions. These usually have a free-flowing, question-and-answer format. Then there are “deal roadshows” meant to sell a specific new fund or product. These are grueling, military-like campaigns spread over a one- or two-week intense trip around the U.S., Asia, or Europe. Four or five meetings a day, a flight in the evening, a few hours of sleep, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>There is a presentation to go over (usually with the visual help of a pitch book), heavily rehearsed and rigidly followed. It’s tedious and repetitive. It is all orchestrated, and not in a Mendelssohn Midsummer Night’s Dream kind of way. We got the same questions, to which we reacted as if the person had asked something no one before had ever thought to ask, and then we gave the same answers. I made the same jokes, and Jeff—I commend his spirit—guffawed each time. (loc 2510)</p>
<p><em>I highlighted this because one very seldom hears about the pitching process</em></p>

<p>As far as distressed investing went, bankruptcy proceedings and rulings are not required disclosure by the SEC and therefore the information was even harder to get, until the PACER system. PACER is an electronic public access service of U.S. federal court documents, which was set up on the web in 2001. It allows users to obtain case and docket information from, among other courts, the bankruptcy courts. (loc 863)</p>

<p>Distressed trading is a game of strategy, positioning, power, and control. Corporations in bankruptcy or under financial stress often have a complex capital structure where equity holders, bondholders, loan holders, trade vendors, and a variety of parties have differing, often opposite economic interests. We ran computer simulations, scenarios, and projections and anticipated the moves of each player. Then, having evaluated the battleground, we would position ourselves strategically and select our weapon, the optimal security (or securities) to make a killing. It was like Game of Thrones minus the sex but with the profanity. (loc 885)</p>

<p>Generating new ideas, innovative thinking, having flashes of intuition that connect the dots—that is what helps a company refinance a bond in a tough market. Being a good listener and open-minded, capable of boiling down complicated facts into simple explanations, negotiating and multitasking—that is what brings investors to coalesce around a plan of reorganization and out of bankruptcy. (loc 906)</p>

<p>The telecom crisis, which promptly followed the dot-com fall, was an entirely different beast. The media largely describes the dot-com and the telecom busts as one and the same. They were not. The latter was a financial calamity of epic scale with enormous consequences to all market participants, shaking not only the equity market (where the dot-com was mostly concentrated and the public mostly affected), but also the investment-grade bond, junk bond, and leveraged loan markets in the U.S. and beyond. (loc 1026)</p>

<p>The reason why distressed funds made so much money back then is not because we were geniuses, not because of nerves of steel, wills of iron, or testicles of brass. It was because of timing, of the confluence of the newness and modest size of the business relative to the market structure and outlandish number of bankruptcies. In other words, happy circumstances. (loc 1114)</p>

<p>Distressed investing takes time, and legal battles are mentally grinding. An average Chapter 11 bankruptcy case takes a year; many take two or three, after many months of preparation to file in court. A reorganization, a turnaround, or a recapitalization can have fits and starts for months or even years before reaching a consensual deal and being consummated. (loc 1303)</p>

<p>They [enhanced equipment trust certificates] a new type of financing for airplanes that took off in the late ’90s. They originate from an old structure used for railway boxcars and rolling stock, where the latter served as security for a loan, similar to a mortgage loan, in which the house is the collateral. Aircraft financiers ingeniously figured they could use this basic structure while enhancing it, making it bankruptcy-remote, issuing senior and junior tranches of debt and equity, and adding a liquidity facility to allow interest payments even if the airline became bankrupt. The point of the enhancements was to make EETC bonds safer than regular airline corporate bonds, and to get them rated higher by the rating agencies, (loc 1257)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In the case of aircraft securitization, one feature is utterly unique and does not even relate to the bond itself, but to a specific section of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, section 1110. EETC bonds are issued by a trust, which uses the money to buy the planes, rents them to the airline, and uses the rent money to pay bond interest. Section 1110 of bankruptcy code specifies that, if the airline files for bankruptcy, it faces a choice within a sixty-day period: either continue to make rental payments (with the bankruptcy court approval) if they want to use the aircraft, or default on the rent, which then enables the trust to repossess and dispose of the aircraft as it sees fit.

<p>Forceful decision-making, particularly if portrayed as a brash, aggressive, in-your-face behavior, as Wall Street is commonly pictured, is not necessarily taught to or embraced by women. It may not reflect a skill that they like or want to identify with. Men generally don’t believe being assertive is a feminine aptitude. (loc 321)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There are studies that seem to conclude that women are more risk averse than men. But it does not follow that men are better decision makers or investors. (loc 329)</p>

<p>It is somewhat a vicious circle: not enough women as role models, which leads, at least partly, to doubting one’s own competence, which cannot be assuaged by female peers. And if there happens to be, oh miracle, one other woman, it is hard to be supportive rather than competitive if, looking around the office, there only seems to be room for one of your kind. It is not so much a glass ceiling as it is a quicksand floor. (loc 629)</p>

<p>The idea that we are all equal and that the harder working or smarter people will naturally come out ahead is simply a childish one, most likely that of a Caucasian upper-middle-class male child. (loc 683)</p>

<p>if a male manager makes a mistake, they will remember the mistake. But if a female hedge fund manager makes a mistake, they will remember the woman. It’s true. There is evidence that people who are employed in an occupation that is strongly associated with the opposite gender are penalized more harshly for errors. (loc 2526)</p>

<p>male advisors are twice as likely to commit misconduct than their female peers. But do women get the benefit of the doubt? Hardly. Female advisors are 20 percent more likely to lose their jobs than male advisors after misconduct. Could this corporate behavior be rationally explained by higher female recidivism or graver wrongdoing? In other words, are females punished harder because they don’t learn and they cost more? No again. Females face harsher outcomes despite engaging in misconduct that is 20 percent less costly and having a substantially lower propensity toward repeat offenses. And here is the clincher: the gap shrinks for branches with more female managers, meaning a greater number of women in positions of power. (loc 2535)</p>

<p>In 2015, Financial Skills (founded by ex-Merrill Lynch traders) studied 326 junior traders. My favorite excerpt comes from the COO, David Hesketh: “We found that men take more risk than women. That would be fine if they also made more money—but they don’t.” (loc 2706)</p>

<p>hysterical is by definition a sexist attribute and one cannot justify its use by arguing that it is a gender-neutral insult. Men cannot be called hysterical, for the good reason that the etymology of the word is “uterus.” Hysteria, or being hysterical, was believed, in the nineteenth century, to be a neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.

<p>Perseverance and the pursuit of self-interest? Yes, that goes for women too. I never apologized for, restrained, or disguised my professional ambition.

<p>The truth is, I felt deeply ashamed for having lost so much money in the 2008 debacle. When you’re down 25 percent, your ability to endure self-doubt is greatly compromised. I rehashed my positions and decision process in a never-ending mental loop. I lost confidence in my ability to invest and make sound judgments on the market. And the way back up wasn’t easy.

<p>2003 to 2007 marked a period of explosive growth for the hedge fund industry. The steep part of the S curve saw industry assets grow from $500 billion in the first quarter of 2003 to $2.3 trillion at the end of 2007, almost quintupling its size in a trivial five years. (loc 1357)</p>

<p>The second and more important impetus for the growth is that we found a powerful preacher in the person of Yale University’s chief investment officer, David Swensen, who had produced returns of over 16 percent for the twenty-year period since his hiring in 1985. (loc 1381)</p>

<p>The original elevator pitch was that hedge funds used their small size relative to the plethora of opportunities to swoop in and capitalize on market inefficiencies, quickly getting in and out of positions. As funds became larger, the pitch morphed into the opposite story. We had access to differentiated sources of inefficiencies because of our size. (loc 1422)</p>

<p>Putting your proverbial money where your mouth is acts as a powerful incentive for managers to perform and rightfully aligns your interests with those of the investors. That is the idea, anyway, and it works to a point—the point at which the fund becomes large enough that management fees are bigger than performance fees. (loc 1622)</p>

<p>The problem with rich people is not that they are different, contrary to what Fitzgerald so eloquently proposed, and it is not just that they have more money, as Hemingway responded. The problem with rich people is that there is no constraint on their stupid ideas. (loc 1655)</p>

<p>I recently heard a podcast with Jim Koch, the cofounder of Boston Beer Company, brewer of Samuel Adams beer. He has an interesting view about risk-taking. Specifically, he highlighted the difference between something scary and something dangerous. Rappelling from a boulder into the void feetfirst is scary but not dangerous, he said, because you’re securely tied to a rope that could hold the weight of a car. However, walking across a soft snow patch in a canyon on a sunny and warm spring afternoon is not scary, but it’s dangerous because that’s the most likely time and place for an avalanche. […]</p>
<p>He proceeded to relate this concept to his leaving a job at the Boston Consulting Group to start a small artisan brewery. It was scary to quit but not dangerous, because “the real risk,” he said, “is wasting your life and not doing what you really want to do.” (loc 578)</p>

<p>The other day I was trying to remember all the ways I invested in tobacco and I ended up sounding like Forrest Gump’s “best good friend” Bubba, the shrimping boat captain. I traded in tobacco risk arbitrage, tobacco spinoffs, tobacco securitization bonds, tobacco high-yield bonds, tobacco equity, tobacco convertible bonds, tobacco manufacturers, and tobacco leaf producers. I realize that investing in tobacco is not socially responsible. I have no excuse for it and I won’t attempt a joke about the French smoking (it’s true; we smoke more than we wash). All I saw at the time were profit opportunities, and the tobacco sector provided me with some of my most successful and enduringly profitable trades. (loc 1544)</p>

<p>I do not think children are particularly well served by helicopter or snowplow parents who obsess over every boo-boo, resolve every conflict, and flatten out every hurdle. It is a lack of respect, a mistrust as it were, rooted in the conviction that the child cannot face life with the inevitable difficulties that ensue on his own. Here’s an idea: your child is not an extension of you. (loc 3033)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too smart for their own good, with strange incentives from the capital markets]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I picked up <em>The Smartest Guys in the Room</em> not so much for the catastrophic accounting fraud, but rather, to understand what Enron did right. There was a time when they were widely seen as the most innovative company in the world and they had their pick of top MBA talent. They must have been doing something right!</p>
<p>It seems that their success came from being at the right place at the right time, plus having the animus to execute on a large scale. Kenneth Lay spotted the trend toward deregulation of natural gas and built a business around it. In fairness, Enron <em>did</em> do many novel things: for example, their “gas bank” allowed producers and consumers to transact with far more confidence and has almost certainly been a net positive – not just for market participants but probably for the world, given the superior carbon emissions profile of gas vs coal. I was somewhat disappointed to learn that the famed energy traders like John Arnold profited massively from the ridiculous information advantage that Enron had, especially via Enron Online which allowed them to see the trades of all the other market participants. Though I guess it’s a good reminder that information drives markets! (In fairness to the traders like Arnold, they went on to find huge success post-Enron which probably suggests their edge wasn’t purely informational). In any case, my main takeaway regarding the success of Enron is as follows: keep an eye out for sea changes in the regulatory and political climate, then build infrastructure into these. Use the superior infrastructure to be more efficient than other competitors and profit.</p>
<p>The fall of Enron illustrates the important lesson from Clayton Christensen in <a href="/?books=how-will-you-measure-your-life" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">How Will You Measure Your Life</a> – the danger of marginal thinking. At every point in time, the marginal cost of the next special purpose vehicle, creative accounting structure, or earnings management technique was small. But in aggregate it led to behaviour that was well over the line. The fall also highlights the importance of culture: Skilling was undoubtedly a genius and had some good ideas about meritocracy, but lacked the EQ to see what was happening to the people around him: Enron was an extremely Darwinian environment with incentives skewed to bringing in business rather than building business, obscuring or even fabricating information to please superiors (and shareholders), selfish to the point of self-destruction. The blame probably shouldn’t be placed primarily on Skilling: I was left with the impression that he was less of a Dr Evil and more of a Frankenstein – a genius who built a monster he couldn’t control.</p>
<p>To be clear, my 3-star review is not at all an indictment of the quality of the journalism. The authors have done an admirable job in piecing together what was undoubtedly an incredibly complex mass of lies, damned lies, and SPVs. Rather, the 3-stars reflects a personal observation: I have gotten rather tired of these types of business narrative books (<a href="/?books=den-of-thieves" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Den of Thieves</a>, <a href="/?books=barbarians-at-the-gate" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Barbarians at the Gate</a>, <a href="/?books=bad-blood" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Bad Blood</a> etc). Though entertaining at times, the authors inevitably descend into an excess of detail, outlining the family backgrounds of most characters so they can add some minor anecdote about their childhood environment. This is somewhat understandable given all the hard work required to piece together the story, but I am at a point in life where information density has really started to matter and I don’t think this genre is terribly suitable for that. But if you are someone who (for whatever reason) wants the specific history of Enron, look no further.</p>

<summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium">Kenneth Lay</summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>It wasn’t until the 1970s that things began to change—or at least to change enough to attract the interest of a bright, shrewd, and intensely ambitious young man like Ken Lay. Far from being afraid of the coming changes, Lay wanted to push things along, to accelerate the pace of change. In later years, colleagues joked about his penchant for taking rapid action—any action—describing Lay’s management style as “Ready, fire, aim.” (loc 454)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A short, balding man with an endearing resemblance to Elmer Fudd, he remembered names, listened earnestly, and seemed to care about what you thought. He had a gift for calming tempers and defusing conflict. (loc 471)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Lay had the traits of a politician: he cared deeply about appearances, he wanted people to like him, and he avoided the sort of tough decisions that were certain to make others mad. His top executives—people like Jeff Skilling—understood this about him and viewed him with something akin to contempt. They knew that as long as they steered clear of a few sacred cows, they could do whatever they wanted and Lay would never say no. (loc 473)</p>
<p><em>Interesting parallel to some of the authoritarian personality types discussed in</em> <em><a href="/?books=on-the-psychology-of-military-incompetence" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">On the Psychology of Military Incompetence</a></em> <em>.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Lay became an inveterate collector of relationships. At each major stop in his early life, he forged bonds that lasted for decades. These weren’t only personal acquaintances. Time and again, he would tap his growing network: for a job, for a favor, or to surround himself with those he trusted. This skill propelled his climb. (loc 514)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Jeff Skilling&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When people describe Skilling they don’t just use the word “smart”; they use phrases like “incandescently brilliant” or “the smartest person I ever met.” Skilling in the late 1980s wasn’t a physically striking man—he was smallish, a little pudgy, and balding—but his mental agility was breathtaking. He could process information and conceptualize new ideas with blazing speed. He could instantly simplify highly complex issues into a sparkling, compelling image. And he presented his ideas with a certainty that bordered on arrogance and brooked no dissent. (loc 991)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For all his brilliance, Skilling had dangerous blind spots. His management skills were appalling, in large part because he didn’t really understand people. He expected people to behave according to the imperatives of pure intellectual logic, but of course nobody does that (including, it should be said, Skilling himself). [...]</p>
<p>Skilling also had a tendency to oversimplify, and he largely disregarded—indeed, he had an active distaste for—the messy details involved in executing a plan. What thrilled Skilling, always, was the intellectual purity of an idea, not the translation of that idea into reality. (loc 1001)</p>
<p><em>“Do you want to be smart or do you want to make money?”</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Skilling graduated a Baker Scholar, a coveted honor bestowed upon the top 5 percent of the class. He decided that his talent was “pattern recognition,” which meant that he thought he was good at seeing how the techniques used in one industry could be applied to another. (loc 1071)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Even by McKinsey standards, Skilling was phenomenally successful, rising through the extremely competitive ranks with almost surreal speed. (loc 1090)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Rather than using historical-cost accounting like everyone else, he wanted Enron Finance be able to use what’s known as mark-to-market accounting. This was so important to him—“a lay-my-body-across-the-tracks issue,” he later called it—that he actually told Lay he would not join Enron and build his new division unless he could use mark-to-market accounting. […]</p>
<p>One rationale in particular spoke volumes about the way Skilling viewed business. He’d never let go of the consultant’s conceit that the idea was all and the idea, therefore, should be the thing that was rewarded. He felt that a business should be able to declare profits at the moment of the creative act that would earn those profits. (loc 1258)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Traders and deal makers alike came to realize that it was easy to hold up Skilling for a raise or a bigger bonus or more options: all they had to was threaten to quit, and Skilling would give in to their demands. Later, when Enron was flying high, the press portrayed Skilling as a Master of the Universe, in control of everything at the company. But the insiders always knew better. As smart as he was, he could be taken advantage of. And take advantage they did. (loc 1678)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Grubman: “You’re the only financial institution that cannot produce a balance sheet or cash-flow statement with their earnings.” Skilling: “Well, you’re—you—well, uh, thank you very much. We appreci- ate it.” Grubman: “Appreciate it?” Skilling: “Asshole.” (loc 7480)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>[Skilling] also had very clear ideas about how to build an organization, what to look for in people, and how those people should be rewarded. At McKinsey, Skilling had always felt that he’d been part of a true intellectual meritocracy, and that’s what he strove to instill at Enron Finance. He wanted to create a place where raw brains and creativity mattered more than management skills and real-world experience, where young MBAs were free to chase a pipe dream with company millions (even behind their boss’s back), where generating profits was rewarded not just handsomely but fabulously, and where those who failed to measure up would be quickly cut from the herd. (loc 1578)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He used to say that he liked to hire “guys with spikes.” By this, he meant that if an executive had a singular narrow talent—a spike—Skilling was willing to bring him into Enron and lavish him with money, no matter what his other shortcomings. Egomaniacs, social misfits, backstabbers, devotees of strip clubs: Skilling didn’t really care about their foibles so long as they had a skill he needed. (loc 1586)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;John Wing&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>John Wing is the forgotten man of the Enron saga. On one level, that’s completely understandable: he left the company nearly a decade before Enron imploded, so one could hardly blame him for what happened. (loc 1346)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But internally, the Enron old-timers never forgot John Wing. With his over-the-top personality, Wing was a mythic figure, by far the most memorable character of Enron’s early days. He was also a genuine moneymaker. At a time when nothing else was working, Wing’s early deals brought the company badly needed cash. His greatest triumph, a landmark power project in England called Teesside, pushed Enron onto the world stage and gave it credibility and profits—real profits, not the mark-to-market kind—that the company milked for the next decade. (loc 1350)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He was so divisive a figure yet so valuable that he was cut loose—and brought back—three separate times. After each parting, Wing somehow emerged with an even richer deal than he had before. His ultimate take from the company exceeded $25 million. (loc 1356)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Wing was Enron’s first true prima donna. He was the first Enron executive to get genuinely rich, the first to insist that he get a piece of the projects he developed, the first to bully Lay into letting him do whatever he wanted, and the first to see Enron not as a place for a long, happy career but rather as a place for mutual exploitation. (loc 1359)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Since the early 1980s, Lay had been eager to invest in cogeneration projects—plants that not only provided electric power but also captured the heat from the plant’s turbines for sale as steam, typically to an industrial facility adjacent to the plant. A well-designed cogen project was clean and profitable and far more efficient than a conventional plant that ran on coal or fuel oil. It also, of course, provided a big new customer for natural gas. (loc 1393)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Part of Wing’s canny genius was knowing when he was in a position to employ maximum leverage. “Always make it about the other guy, never about yourself,” Wing liked to say. By that he meant that a good negotiator needs to create a set of possible outcomes that allow him to win no matter what the other side does. (loc 1407)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>John Wing was convinced that the best prospects were in England, so that’s where he headed. He was going to build a gas-fired cogeneration plant at Teesside, and not just any gas-fired cogeneration plant. He was going to build the biggest cogen project the world had ever seen: a 1,825-megawatt monster, big enough to supply 4 percent of the electricity needs for the entire United Kingdom. The estimated cost was $1.3 billion. (loc 1432)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What he realized was that England was poised to begin deregulating its energy industry, just as the United States had done a decade before. (loc 1436)</p>
<p><em>Same theme: deregulation creates massive opportunity</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When progress inevitably bogged down, Wing assumed his old role as jam-breaker. “The time for dancing is over!” he declared to a roomful of lawyers, pounding his fist on the table. “The time for killing has begun.” (loc 1476)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Ever the master negotiator, Wing was also grandly manipulative with his own staff. He’d periodically tell even trusted subordinates they were failures, strip them of their titles, or make them report to someone junior. “We were all fired at least ten times,” recalls one member of the team. Those who worked directly for Wing never quite knew where they stood. Which, of course, was the idea. (loc 1511)</p>
<p><em>Another hat tip to the awful darwinian culture at Enron</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Rebecca Mark&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To the outside world, the person who was Enron, who had a reputation for turning impossible concepts into glittering realities, was not Skilling. It was Rebecca Mark. (loc 1904)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Skilling wanted to figure out ways to separate energy from the hard assets needed to produce it; Mark’s business was nothing but hard assets. Trading was all about hedging away risk and quickly capturing profits. International development, where it could take a decade to recoup your money, meant taking on uncontrollable risks—everything (loc 1916)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Mark, who at first ran and reran numbers to make sure her deals made economic sense, became sloppy, says one person who worked with her closely. Because she was tearing all over the world trying to juggle a million balls, important details fell through the cracks. And while Enron International executives loved putting deals together, the business had a flaw that was endemic to Enron: no one felt responsible for managing the projects once they were up and running. (loc 2046)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The money Enron poured into projects that never were built—and such a failed deal could soak up tens of millions—was supposed to be written off. In Vietnam, for instance, one accountant says that Enron spent some $18 million trying to build a power plant, only to see the project canceled. Yet Enron International often booked such costs as an asset on the balance sheet, in what came to be known around the company as “the snowball.” Usually the rationale was that there was no official letter saying the project was dead, so therefore, officially, it wasn’t. Rich Kinder had a rule: the snowball had to stay under $90 million. But it eventually ballooned to over $200 million. (loc 2070)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Developers got bonuses on a project-by-project basis. The developers would calculate the present value of all the expected future cash flow from a project. This was also the model the banks used to lend money. When the project reached financial close—that is, when the banks lent money but before a single pipe was laid or foundation was poured—they were paid. (loc 2093)</p>
<p><em>Recognising cash flows up front removes incentive to properly manage the projects</em></p>

<p>Muckleroy quickly discovered that things were far worse than anyone realized. Enron Oil was short over 84 million barrels. The position was so huge that it amounted to roughly three months’ output of the gigantic North Sea oil field off the coast of England. If Enron were forced to cover its position, it would have been on the hook for well over $1 billion. “Less than worthless” was exactly the right description: when you added $1 billion-plus to Enron’s $4 billion in debt, the company’s total debts outstripped its net worth. And, of course, given how strapped the company was for cash, there was simply no way it could cover its trading losses without filing for bankruptcy. (loc 891)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>His only hope was to bluff his way out of his dilemma; if other traders knew what trouble Enron Oil was in, they were likely to bid the price of oil even higher, then demand payment. To fool them, Muckleroy pretended that Enron had crude oil in hand; he even bought some to sell into the market. The bluff bought him time. Within a few days, oil prices began to decline. Or at least they fell enough that Muckleroy and his team were able to close down Enron Oil’s positions, reducing the damage to the company to around $140 million. That still hurt, but it was no longer life-threatening. “If the market moved up three more dollars Enron would have gone belly up,” Muckleroy later said. “Lay and Seidl never understood that.” (loc 901)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>through their access to the nationwide electric grid, utilities could tell in an instant when a plant anywhere in the country had gone down, a move that might spike a region’s prices in a matter of minutes. To put it another way, they had precisely the kind of information advantage Enron had in natural gas. (loc 2682)</p>

<p>No longer satisfied with being “the world’s first gas major,” Enron had adopted a new, more aggressive corporate goal: to become “The World’s Leading Energy Company.” (loc 2716)</p>

<p>Physical assets were always the foundation for Skilling’s own business success. Enron’s pipeline system revealed the secrets for making a fortune trading natural gas; the Portland General acquisition provided entrée into the new world of electricity trading. Later Skilling bought paper mills so Enron could start trading pulp and paper, and a billion-dollar fiber network launched broadband trading. Skilling thought he had it down to a formula: Enron would buy the infrastructure needed to crack the code, build a new trading business—and then unload the assets when everybody else started to pile in (loc 2766)</p>
<p><em>Seems like a pretty decent plan</em></p>

<p>The traders were smart, by and large, and they were good at what they did. But their insular culture had a dangerous edge; not only was it self-righteous, but it could never see beyond its own value system. (loc 5004)</p>

<p>He believed in a culture that maximized the ability of individuals to make their own decisions and reap their own rewards. “People were able to take risks the way they wanted and be accountable for it, which is the most sacred thing in a trading shop,” says a former trader. (loc 5027)</p>

<p>Another Whalley aide was John Sherriff, a former gas trader who ran Enron Europe. The Sherriff legend was that he had made an enormous amount—tens of millions—in a single bet on short-term gas prices back in the mid-1990s, when the business was still in its early stages and such a windfall was not believed possible. All the members of Whalley’s core group shared a short-term mind-set, and all of them reveled in taking huge risks. (loc 5070)</p>

<p>In late 2000, a 26-year-old superstar trader named John Arnold—who was revered for being able to do complex mathematical equations instantly in his head—hit a bad losing streak and went from being up $200 million to being down $200 million in the space of less than a month. On Wall Street, such a performance might well have gotten Arnold fired. But when Skilling heard what had happened, Whalley told him that everything was cool. And so Skilling came down to the thirty-second floor, where the traders worked, and put his arm around Arnold in a public show of support. (loc 5146)</p>
<p><em>Part of the story that one doesn’t hear about John Arnold</em></p>

<p>One of Enron’s key advantages over its competitors was information: it simply had more of it than its competitors. Its physical assets provided information, of course. And Enron didn’t stop there. It employed former CIA agents who could find out anything about anyone. Instead of tracking the weather on the Weather Channel, the company had a meteorologist on staff. He’d arrive at the office at 4:30 A.M., download data from a satellite, and meet with the traders at 7:00 A.M. to share his insights. (The traders would also call him for weather reports before they left for vacation.) Early on, Enron employees paid farmers located near power plants to let them put cameras on fences to monitor activity. Later, the stunts grew more elaborate. Once, the company sent an analyst to pose as a porta-potty salesman. His task was to figure out how long a plant was supposed to be under construction so the traders could learn when it might start producing power. Enron sent analysts to meetings of the Washington State’s electric commission, where policy makers talked about the level of water in various dams. When the level was high, that meant there was plenty of hydroelectric power, so the traders might short electricity. “Lo and behold, the dam would release water, prices would drop, and we’d make a ton,” says one former executive. “We just sat there dumbfounded, thinking, this can’t be that easy.” (loc 5181)</p>
<p><em>Information arbitrage</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>By the late 1990s, these research efforts were herded together into something called the fundamentals group—fundies in trader parlance. The fundies group produced intelligence reports and held morning briefings on everything from new power plants to the state of the economy to production levels at different E&amp;P companies. They analyzed gas storage levels, the demand coming from important industries like fertilizers and chemicals, and outtages at power plants. Individual traders could digest that information and establish whatever positions they saw fit. The traders considered the fundies group a huge advantage. (loc 5191)</p>

<p>With Enron Online, Enron controlled the energy exchange completely. (loc 5204)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>California electricity scandal</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Not only was Belden an Enron trader, he was one of the leaders of a group of hyperaggressive West Coast electricity traders who operated out of Portland General, the Oregon utility Enron purchased in 1997. (loc 6125)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Belden had always had a bit of the mad scientist in him, and in the late spring of 1999, he began working on an intriguing idea. Deregulation of California’s energy market had gone into effect the year before, creating an enormous opportunity for energy traders, who were suddenly in the position of buying and selling a huge portion of the state’s electricity. The sheer complexity of the rules governing deregulation seemed to make them exploitable in another way as well. Clever traders could find loopholes in the thousand or so pages of rules and game the system in much the same way Andy Fastow’s team gamed the accounting rules. For instance: what would happen if a trader sold energy to the state for the next day but scheduled it in such a way that the electricity couldn’t possibly be delivered? (loc 6131)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In other words, Belden had scheduled 2,900 megawatts on a line that could only absorb a tiny fraction of that amount. […]</p>
<p>Because there was no way for Belden’s power to be delivered, the PX didn’t have the supply it thought it had. And so the ISO, which handled such emergencies, had to hustle to find replacement supplies. Because the agency was forced to buy a substantial amount of power at the last minute, prices in California shot up by more than 70 percent, resulting in a cost of as much as $7 million to users. (loc 6227)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In one scheme, Enron submitted a schedule reflecting demand that wasn’t there. The West Coast traders called that one Fat Boy. Another was a variation of the Silverpeak experiment: Enron filed imaginary transmission schedules in order to get paid to alleviate congestion that didn’t really exist. That was called Death Star. Get Shorty was a strategy that involved selling power and other services that Enron did not have for use as reserves, with the expectation that Enron would never be called upon to supply the power or would be able to buy it later at a lower price. The point of Ricochet was to circumvent California’s price caps. For instance, Enron exported power from California and brought it back in when the ISO was desperate and had to pay far higher prices. (This strategy, which was used by all the power traders, was more widely known as “megawatt laundering.”) (loc 6250)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>On May 22, 2000, the ISO was forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, because its power reserves had dropped below 7 percent. Before May, prices had averaged $24 to $40 per megawatt hour; now they quickly hit the price cap of $750 per megawatt hour. Industry experts were in a state of shock: it wasn’t even summer yet, and supply and demand were not wildly out of whack. Why was the price of electricity going up so much? (loc 6302)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>By the end of the summer, California was in full-crisis mode. And Enron was taking full advantage: Belden and his West Coast trading desk were booking profits the likes of which they’d never seen before, some $200 million just between May and August of 2000, according to a presentation Enron later gave to Moody’s. That was roughly four times the profit the desk had made in all of 1999, according to the government. (loc 6320)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Skilling “clearly thinks Californians should be thanking Enron, not castigating it, for its role in trying to push open the state’s power markets,” wrote BusinessWeek in February 2001. “We’re on the side of angels,” Skilling said. (loc 6500)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Enron’s North American trading desk had made a staggering $2.2 billion for the year, (loc 6533)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>The Fall of Enron</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>As Skilling saw it, Enron had fallen victim to a cabal of short sellers and scoop-hungry reporters that triggered a classic run on the bank. Privately, he would grudgingly acknowledge occasional business mistakes—including one, the failure of Enron’s broadband venture, that cost the company more than $1 billion. (loc 388)</p>
<p><em>Hubris led him to believe that he could export his model to the brand new area of broadband.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>what brought Enron down was something more complex—and more tragic—than simple thievery. The tale of Enron is a story of human weakness, of hubris and greed and rampant self-delusion; of ambition run amok; of a grand experiment in the deregulated world; of a business model that didn’t work; and of smart people who believed their next gamble would cover their last disaster—and who couldn’t admit they were wrong. (loc 412)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He would openly ask the stock analysts: “What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?” And the number he arrived at was the number Wall Street was looking for, regardless of whether internally it made any sense. (loc 3133)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Here was the rub, though. Enron couldn’t simply sell the international projects outright. Why? Because the various agreements it had with its lenders and partners often required it to maintain a majority ownership of the assets. Yet under accounting rules, if Enron were deemed to control EPP, it would not be allowed to realize profits when it sold stakes in the assets to EPP. It was a classic catch-22, (loc 2431)</p>
<p>Enron, they decided, would retain slightly more than 50 percent of the assets, but it would set up an oversight committee consisting of three directors who would independently approve every transaction. Astonishingly, Arthur Andersen agreed that this would mean Enron didn’t control EPP and could therefore book profits when it sold assets to EPP. (loc 2435)</p>
<p><em>So obviously working against the spirit of the law</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Eventually, the whole thing took on a life of its own, with an insane logic that no one at the company dared contemplate: to a staggering degree, Enron’s “profits” and “cash flow” were the result of the company’s own complex dealings with itself. At which point, of course, there could hardly be any doubt: Enron had most certainly crossed the line. (loc 3267)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Because they could come up with plausible rationales for why a given structure was technically valid, they believed they were on the right side of the law. (loc 3481)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“There are a number of areas,” the firm pointed out to Enron’s board in a 2000 audit update, “where accounting rules have not kept up with the company’s practices. . . . (loc 3580)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In mid-2002, the Enron debacle prompted the passage of a controversial new set of corporate-oversight rules known as Sarbanes-Oxley, aimed squarely at the abuses that had led to the scandal. Among other provisions, it required CEOs and CFOs to personally attest to the accuracy of their company’s financial statements; imposed new requirements for auditor independence and independent audit committees; banned most personal loans to executives and board members; barred insider trades during pension-fund blackout periods; and stiffened penalties for securities fraud. President George W. Bush proclaimed the law “the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.” (loc 9334)</p>

<p>“I knew that what I was doing was misleading,” Fastow told the Las Vegas crowd. “But I didn’t think it was illegal. I thought: That’s how the game is played. You have a complex set of rules, and the objective is to use the rules to your advantage.” (loc 9714)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know he would not be a wolf, but that he sees the Romans are but sheep]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given my renewed interest in Roman history, <em>Julius Caesar</em> was desperately due for a re-read.</p>
<p>Those who are only vaguely familiar with the story will assume that Brutus is the villain – he who betrayed his Caesar and his friend. But Brutus is the tragic hero (an imperfect, human hero to be sure) of the story. He is a complex character torn between his love for Caesar and his love of the Roman people. <em>Act II Scene I</em> shows him struggle over whether Caesar would become a tyrant-king, or whether the man he served and loved would remain aligned with the best interests of the people. Ultimately, under prodding from less noble men, Noble Brutus puts his love of the people above his love of Caesar and joins the fateful conspiracy.</p>
<p>His conversations with Cassius are delightful, full of decadent language and brimming with brotherly love.</p>
<p>Noble to the bitter end – “this was a man!”</p>
<p>There are many (deservedly) famous speeches.<em>Act III</em> contains all of the classics: “Friends, Romans, Countrymen” etc. But this is my favourite act of the play for a different reason. It highlights the fickleness and weakness of the Roman people: after Brutus’ speech in <em>Scene II</em> , the Roman people cry “let him be Caesar!” and not long after, they say the same of Mark Antony. This aspect of the Roman people was foreshadowed earlier on in the play when Cassius acknowledges that Caesar would only be a tyrant because the Roman people would demand it of him – ”poor man”.</p>
<p>This is what makes the play a true tragedy: Julius Caesar was a Great Man, but the people could never let him be just that. They wanted a King, nay, a God. Cassius knew as much, but appealed to the nobility (and naivety?) of Brutus. Brutus, the tragic hero of the play, tried to give the people something they were not ready to accept: the freedom to choose their own destiny. The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I believe in my own fallibility]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soros is known by many as the “man who broke the Bank of England” and one would be forgiven for assuming that he is a brusque, buccaneering speculator. This couldn’t be farther from the truth! Soros styles himself as a “failed philosopher” – indeed, he spent several years attempting to do original work on philosophy, developing the ideas that would later become Reflexivity Theory. Since the philosophical establishment largely ignored his work (possibly with good reason – it’s hard to know given I haven’t formally studied philosophy), he applied his theories to markets and the rest is history.</p>
<p><em>Soros on Soros</em> is a an elegant retrospective on his life and thinking. The discussions of Reflexivity Theory were excellent (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCaCrWzFPYY">these lectures</a> for a possibly more accessible introduction), but I particularly appreciated the overview of Soros’ epistemology (from which Reflexivity Theory derives). His entire worldview – encompassing Open Society, reflexivity, financial markets – derives from one core statement: “I believe in my own fallibility”. Based on this one axiom, he builds a cogent and practical theory of decision-making in a world where the decisions of thinking participants impact reality. It doesn’t make a huge difference to me whether these ideas are original in the context of Western Philosophy, or that Soros is probably too imprecise to satisfy “true” philosophers – the ideas are fascinating and seem to have explanatory power.</p>
<p>Something that comes through very clearly (perhaps the hint is in the title) is Soros’ incredible capacity for introspection. This is a characteristic that seems to be shared by many other hedge fund legends (as per the <em>Market Wizards</em> series) but Soros takes it to the extreme. It’s abundantly clear that he has deeply reflected on his goals and weaknesses:</p>
<p><em>Soros on Soros</em> is, at times, a challenging read (it has taken me several weeks to trawl through the highlights I made!). But this is only because it is so full of wisdom, the bulk of which I’m sure I haven’t been able to appreciate on the first pass. I look forward to reviewing my highlights a few months from now – I’m sure there’ll be many nuggets I missed!</p>

<p>It is a rather unusual structure, because we use leverage. We position the fund to take advantage of larger trends – we call this macroinvesting – and then, within those larger trends we also pick stocks and stock groups. (loc 102)</p>

<p>we are willing to invest our capital along three axes: we have a stock exposure, we have an interest rate exposure, and we have a currency exposure. (loc 138)</p>

<p>Our portfolio is more like a building. It has a structure; it has leverage. Using our equity capital as the base, we construct a three-dimensional structure that is supported by the collateral value of the underlying securities. (loc 105)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>we rarely write options. It just doesn&#39;t fit into our three-dimensional structure-it kind of sticks out of the window and threatens to topple the building. That&#39;s why we have relatively little use for options. (loc 123)</p>

<p>I try to change my style to fit the conditions. If you look at the history of the Fund, it has changed its character many times. For the first ten years, it used practically no macro instruments. Afterwards, macro investing became the dominant theme. But more recently, we started investing in industrial assets. I would put it this way: I do not play according to a given set of rules; I look for changes in the rules of the game. (loc 195)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I work with hypotheses. I form a thesis about the anticipated sequence of events and then I compare the actual course of events with my thesis; that gives me a criterion by which I can evaluate my hypothesis. (loc 200)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Let me give you another example: There are periods of choppy markets when my style of investing is worse than useless. I insist on formulating a thesis before I take a position. But it takes time to discover a rationale for a perceived trend in the market; and sometimes the market will reverse the trend just when I manage to formulate a theory justifying it. If it happens repeatedly, it can be devastating. I am good at riding the tide, but not the ripples of a swimming pool. (loc 283)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I am very cautious about going against the herd; I am liable to be trampled on. According to my theory of initially self-reinforcing, but eventually self-defeating trends, the trend is your friend most of the way; trend followers only get hurt at inflection points, where the trend changes. Most of the time I am a trend follower, but all the time I am aware that I am a member of a herd and I am on the lookout for inflection points. (loc 226)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I had to pull back, which I did with alacrity because my principle is to survive first and make money afterwards. (loc 914)</p>

<p>My sense of insecurity is satisfied when I know what the flaw is. It doesn&#39;t make me discard the thesis. Rather, I can play it with greater confidence because I know what is wrong with it while the market does not. I am ahead of the curve. (loc 233)</p>

<p>running an investment portfolio is not work in the ordinary sense of the word. It is something else. It is risk taking. The amount of work you need to do is inversely related to your success. [...]</p>
<p>If you make the right judgment, if you have the right insight, then you don&#39;t need to work very hard. But if you make a mistake, and there is a divergence between your hypothesis and the actual course of events, you need to do some really serious research to find out what&#39;s wrong. (loc 335)</p>

<p>There are many people who love working. They amass an inordinate amount of information, much more than is necessary to reach a conclusion. And they become attached to certain investments because they know them intimately. I am different. I concentrate on the essentials. When I have to, I work furiously because I am furious that I have to work. When I don&#39;t have to, I don&#39;t work. (loc 342)</p>

<p>I am not a professional security analyst. I would rather call myself an insecurity analyst. [...]</p>
<p>I recognize that I may be wrong. This makes me insecure. My sense of insecurity keeps me alert, always ready to correct my errors. I do this on two levels. On the abstract level, I have turned the belief in my own fallibility into the cornerstone of an elaborate philosophy. On a personal level, I am a very critical person who looks for defects in myself as well as in others. But, being so critical, I am also quite forgiving. (loc 210)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I couldn&#39;t recognize my mistakes if I couldn&#39;t forgive myself. To others, being wrong is a source of shame; to me, recognizing my mistakes is a source of pride. Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition, there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes. (loc 212)</p>

<p>The German occupation came in March 1944. I was not yet 14. That was my father&#39;s finest hour, because he knew how to act. He understood the situation; he realized that the normal rules did not apply. Obeying the law became a dangerous addiction; flaunting it was the way to survive. Having experienced the Russian Revolution, he knew what to do. He made arrangements for the family to get false identity papers, and he found places for us to live or to hide. (loc 451)</p>

<p>Here I was, extremely successful, but I made a point of denying my success. I worked like a dog. I felt that it would endanger my success if I abandoned my sense of insecurity. And what was my reward? More money, more responsibility, more work-and more pain-because I relied on pain, as a decision-making tool. (loc 805)</p>

<p>I decided to come to terms with my success by accepting the fact that I was successful even if it meant that I ceased to be successful, because my success was dependent on my self-denying, self-critical, self-torturing attitude.

I had to start enjoying the fruits of my success; otherwise the whole endeavor did not make sense. [...]</p>

<p>I have talked about my messianic fantasies; I am not ashamed of them; the world would be a grim place without such fantasies. But they are fantasies. And to be godlike is to be removed from humanity. The great benefit of the foundation to me personally was that it brought me in touch with humanity. But the explosive growth of the foundation and the sheer size of the operation brought with it the danger that I would become estranged from humanity once again. I became an awesome figure, and I could see, particularly in Russia, that people simply could not understand what I was all about. (loc 2103)</p>

<p>True, I have carved myself a place on Mount Rushmore as a money manager and I am unlikely to lose it, whatever happens. It may just erode a little.

But this preoccupation with myself is beginning to have some harmful side effects. I became a public personality in order to promote certain ideas.

This is a prime example of how good deeds don&#39;t go unpunished. My original purpose in setting up the Open Society Foundation was to create a society where this kind of conspiracy theory wouldn&#39;t flourish; but in the process of advocating an open society, I amassed a sort of mystic power that actually fostered the conspiracy theory.

<p>Our understanding of the world in which we live is inherently imperfect. There is always a discrepancy between the participant&#39;s views and expectations and the actual state of affairs. Sometimes the discrepancy is so small that it can be disregarded but, at other times, the gap is so large that it becomes an important factor in determining the course of events. History is made by the participant&#39;s errors, biases, and misconceptions. (loc 687)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Reality is reflected in people&#39;s thinking – this is the <strong>cognitive function</strong>. On the other hand, people make decisions that affect reality and these decisions are based not on reality, but on people&#39;s interpretation of reality – I call this the <strong>participating function</strong>. The two functions work in opposite directions and in certain circumstances they can interfere with each other. The interaction between them takes the form of a two-way reflexive feedback mechanism. (loc 981)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I now recognise that I have been quite imprecise in using certain words, even the term &quot;reflexivity.&quot; I use it to describe the structure of events that have thinking participants. I also use it to describe specific instances where the two-way feedback mechanism disrupts both the course of events and the participants&#39; perceptions in a way that gives rise to a disequilibrium. [...]</p>
<p>The first is a way of looking at things, a general theory that has universal validity. The second is a phenomenon that occurs only intermittently, but when it does, it makes history. (loc 997)</p>
<p><em>I.e distinguish between “reflexivity” the philosophy and reflexive events</em></p>

<p>A thinking participant is in a very difficult position, because he is trying to understand a situation in which he is one of the actors.</p>
<p>The participants&#39; perceptions influence the market in which they participate, but the market action also influences the participants&#39; perceptions. They cannot obtain perfect knowledge of the market because their thinking is always affecting the market and the market is affecting their thinking. (loc 1004)</p>

<p>In what you might consider the normal situation, the discrepancy between thinking and reality is not very large and there are forces at play that tend to bring them closer together, partly because people can learn from experience, and partly because people can actually change and shape social conditions according to their desires. These are what I call near-equilibrium conditions. But there are other circumstances in which people&#39;s thinking and the actual state of affairs are very far removed from each other, and have no tendency to come closer together. These are what I call far-from-equilibrium conditions. (loc 1038)</p>

<p>There are cases of dynamic disequilibrium when the prevailing bias and the prevailing trend reinforce each other until the gap between them becomes so wide that it brings a catastrophic collapse. There are also cases of static disequilibrium, although they can rarely be found in financial markets. They are characterized by a very rigid, dogmatic mode of thinking, and very rigid social conditions; neither of them changes, (loc 1043)</p>

<p>We may envisage dynamic and static disequilibrium as the two extremes, with near-equilibrium conditions in between. I like to compare these three states of affairs to the three states in which water can be found in nature: liquid, frozen, or steam. (loc 1049)</p>

<p>A boom/bust process occurs only when market prices find a way to influence the so-called fundamentals that are supposed to be reflected in market prices. (loc 1064)</p>

<p>When the process is complete, neither the trend nor the bias remains the same. The process does not repeat itself. There is a regime change. (loc 1102)</p>

<p>Boom/bust process does not only go from near-equilibrium to dynamic disequilibrium, but it may also include static disequilibrium; in that case, the period of acceleration manifests itself as a period of increased rigidity. (loc 1161)</p>

<p>The alchemists made a big mistake trying to turn base metals into gold by incantation. With chemical elements, alchemy doesn&#39;t work. But it does work in the financial markets, because incantations can influence the decisions of the people who shape the course of events. (loc 3185)</p>

<p>Looking at the boundary line between static disequilibrium and near-equilibrium, I would say that in a near-equilibrium situation people are aware of the difference between thinking and reality and recognize that the two do not always coincide. They are willing to learn from experience and they exert themselves to realize their aspirations. These efforts prevent their thinking from straying too far from reality. By contrast, in static disequilibrium, people fail to distinguish between the subjective and the objective, or accept a dogma as the ultimate truth. (loc 3212)</p>

<p>It is when we come to the boundary line with dynamic disequilibrium that I have some difficulty in formulating my thoughts properly. The separation between thinking and reality becomes blurred, but this time it is because reality has become too unstable. It ceases to command the respect it enjoys in near-equilibrium conditions; it becomes more threatening and more malleable at the same time. This does not happen by itself: The participants&#39; value systems are also unhinged. There is a mutual self-reinforcing interaction between the values that guide people and the course of events. We are on familiar ground: We are talking about boom/bust processes. (loc 3217)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What distinguishes boom/bust processes that get out of hand from those that abort?</p>
<p>The question is more easily answered in the financial markets than in a purely abstract form. If you recall the various examples I have used, you will find that in all cases where the process gets out of hand, there is a flaw in the prevailing values. The usual flaw is that what people believe to be fundamental values turns out to be reflexive. This was the case in the conglomerate boom: People believed that earnings per share was something independent of the market value of the shares. (loc 3222)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There is another source of instability, which I haven&#39;t mentioned. When people operate without fundamental values, when they recognize that markets are reflexive and &quot;the trend is your friend,&quot; markets do, in fact, become unstable. That is what happens in currency markets. As I showed in The Alchemy of Finance, trend-following speculation renders a freely fluctuating exchange rate system unstable and the instability is cumulative: the longer it lasts, the more unstable it becomes. (loc 3227)</p>
<p><em>Reflexivity also applies to reflexivity theory: when people start citing reflexivity theory, the market is unstable.</em></p>

<p>Sterling, as you know, was part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), and that mechanism functioned in a near-equilibrium condition for a fairly long period of time. It was actually a very clever, sophisticated system that allowed for frequent adjustments and the adjustments were not severe enough that speculators like me could make a lot of money out of them.

<p>The flaw was that the Bundesbank played a dual role in the system: It was both the anchor of the ERM and the constitutional protector of the stability of the German currency. During the near-equilibrium period, the Bundesbank could fill both roles without any problems, but the reunification of Germany, which caused the exchange of the East German currency for deutschemark at a very high, excessive rate, created a conflict between the two roles of the Bundesbank: (loc 1187)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the tremendous injection of capital from West Germany into East Germany set up strong inflationary pressures within the German economy. The Bundesbank was duty-bound-by the constitution, not just by law-to counteract it by pushing up interest rates and it did so with considerable vigor. This was at a time when Europe in general, and Britain in particular, were in the depths of a recession. (loc 1193)</p>

<p>there was conflict over these three issues: one, that Germany needed a different monetary policy than the rest of Europe; two, that the Bundesbank advocated a different fiscal policy for Germany than the one that Chancellor Kohl actually adopted; and three, that the Bundesbank was fighting for its institutional survival.

<p>institutional investors expected the European currencies to be unified in one continuous process, so they concluded that exchange rates would fluctuate even less than they had in the past. Everyone rushed out to buy high-yielding bonds in the weaker currencies. This made the ERM more rigid than it had been before, and set it up for a radical break rather than a gradual adjustment.

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Japan had a very high savings rate, a strong currency, and extremely low inflation and interest rates, and a very highly priced stock market that enabled Japanese companies to raise capital at a very low cost, and that gave them a competitive advantage. At the same time, Japan had a limited supply of land, which was reinforced by rigid regulations such as the Sunshine Laws, which restricted the building of high-rise buildings. So there was a physical shortage and the cost of housing went up much faster than wages. This induced people to save even more in order to buy a house. You had a self-reinforcing process at work to maximize savings and to minimize the rise in living standards. (loc 1302)</p>

<p>foreign investors acting as a herd always prove to be wrong. This applied to the United States investors buying European securities in the late 1950s and early 1960s that came to a bad end with the Interest Equalization Tax in 1962. It was true of United States institutions buying Japanese securities that turned out to be a false move in 1972. It was true of Japanese institutions investing abroad in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The repatriation of these funds has accounted for the strength of the yen in 1994. And it is certainly true of this global investing mania that reached its climax in December 1994.

<p>One of the ways in which we cope with our imperfect understanding is by carrying whatever knowledge, experience, or insight we have gained to areas that it does not cover.

<p>So we need to examine what kind of true statements we can make. There are singular statements that correspond to specific facts and there are rules by which the truth of some statements can be derived from other statements, notably in mathematics and logic.

<p>If you consider our position as human beings trying to understand the world in which we live, you will find that we cannot confine our thinking to subjects that are independent of our thinking.

<p>Suppose now that I proposed a theory that predicted the behavior of the stock market; surely it would affect the behavior of the stock market.

Look at the rhetoric of the last few years: it is all about competitiveness, very little about free trade. With this attitude, I cannot see the global system surviving.

<p>The old Soviet economy was incredibly distorted: The producer goods industry, including military goods, was called Sector A and it accounted for 75 percent of industrial production; light industry, called Sector B, was only 25 percent. In a market economy, the proportions are reversed. (loc 2256)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Normally the establishment of a legal infrastructure comes first; direct foreign investment next; and the development of foreign portfolio investment last. In this case, the order was reversed: foreign portfolio investment came first and it acted as a catalyst for the emergence of robber capitalism. (loc 2312)</p>

<p>It was well within the powers of the Western democracies to slow down the disintegration of the Soviet Union and lay the foundations of an open society before the closed society collapsed. All it would have taken was some positive reinforcement for Gorbachev&#39;s policies of glasnost and perestroika. He was dying for it. He had a naive belief that, once he provided an opening, the free world would rush in to help. But the Western governments lacked the vision and the political will. (loc 2349)</p>

<p>The stable world order that prevailed during the Cold War has broken down, and no new order has taken its place. (loc 2574)</p>

<p>The Cold War was not an attractive order, but it had a large element of stability built into it. There were two superpowers, representing two diametrically opposed forms of social organization, locked in deadly combat. But they were obliged to respect each other&#39;s vital interests because they were operating in conditions of mutually assured destruction. (loc 2579)</p>

<p>Professional diplomats and statesmen are trained to deal with relations between states. They are intellectually unprepared to deal with a situation where a state like Yugoslavia disintegrates. (loc 2607)</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Bosnia is playing the same role for the United Nations as Abyssinia did for the League of Nations in 1935. (loc 2713)</p>

<p>You yourself called the United Nations ineffective and wasteful. Why is that?</p>
<p>Very simple. It is an association of sovereign states. The members are guided by their national interests, not by the collective interest. And the organization is responsible not to one master, but to many. This compounds the defects of bureaucracies because the main objective of a bureaucracy is to survive. Having many masters engenders a can&#39;t-do, protect-your-behind attitude. (loc 2727)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mythology is a mirror for society]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a child, I was fascinated by Greek mythology: the bold and fantastical stories of Gods and Heroes; the “just so” explanations of why things are the way they are. Later on, science began to carry this torch for me, but mythology was always a fond interest, perhaps re-ignited in my middle-school years by the Percy Jackson series, which I must have read end-to-end at least thrice.</p>
<p><em>Mythos</em> is a delightful re-invigoration of some of the classic tales, along with many lesser known story arcs. It is beautifully written, brimming with Stephen Fry’s delightful wit and spicing up timeless stories with a modern flavour.</p>
<p>Beyond the pure entertainment value, <em>Mythos</em> has been an important reminder of the value of the Classics. It’s remarkable how much of modern arts (maybe even modern thinking) derives from these tales – there are, of course, the “obvious” references like George Bernard Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em> (My Fair Lady), but more interestingly is the rich etymology that mythology provides.</p>
<p>I was particularly fascinated by the nuance with which the Greeks characterised different aspects of both nature and human personality. Whether or not they genuinely believed in these deities is besides the point – I think their enumeration of the manifold facets of social and physical reality demonstrates a self-knowledge that has perhaps been lost nowadays. Consider some of the offspring of Erebus and Nyx:</p>
<p>Mythology is a mirror for the mythologiser. Greek deities, like the humans who dreamt them up, can be kind, brave, thoughtful, and generous – but they are also jealous, petty, conniving, and mean! What emerges from these tales, far beyond pure entertainment value, is a set of timeless stories that convey a nuanced understanding of humans and our interactions with the world. It is not scientific, nor should it be.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>On Greek mythology</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The gods of Greece, if we are archaeological and palaeoanthropological about it all, can be traced back to the sky fathers, moon goddesses and demons of the ‘fertile crescent’ of Mesopotamia – today’s Iraq, Syria and Turkey. (loc 119)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Greeks did not grovel before their gods. They were aware of their vain need to be supplicated and venerated, but they believed men were their equal. (loc 130)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Their myths understand that whoever created this baffling world, with its cruelties, wonders, caprices, beauties, madness and injustice, must themselves have been cruel, wonderful, capricious, beautiful, mad and unjust. (loc 131)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Myths, however, are imaginative, symbolic constructs. No one believes that Hephaestus ever truly existed. He stands as a representation of the arts of metalwork, manufacture and craftsmanship. (loc 5101)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Symbolical rather than historical in origin as myths and mythical figures might be, they underwent the same fictional remodelling and embellishments as more factually rooted legends. (loc 5107)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What makes the Greeks so appealing to us is that they seemed to be so subtly, insightfully and animatedly aware of these different sides to their natures. ‘Know thyself’ was carved into the pronaos of the temple of Apollo at Delphi. As a people – if we read them through the myths as much as in their other writings – they did their best to attend to that ancient maxim. (loc 5126)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>while they may have been far from perfect, the ancient Greeks seem to have developed the art of seeing life, the world and themselves with greater candour and unclouded clarity than is managed by most civilizations, including perhaps our own. (loc 5129)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium">Zeus</summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Those who speak truth to power usually end up in chains or an early grave, but inside Zeus’s head Metis could never be silenced. (loc 1198)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Hera&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There is much about Hera that brings to mind the Roman emperor Augustus’s wife Livia (loc 1222)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>as King of the Gods, his authority rested on accepting and endorsing the other gods’ right to rule their own spheres and exercise their own will. He could not interfere and countermand Hera’s edict or undo her awful spell. (loc 1228)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Sorrowing at the death of her beloved servant, Hera took Argus’s hundred bright eyes and fixed them onto the tail of a very dull, dowdy old fowl, transforming it into what we know today as the peacock – which is how the now proud, colourful and haughty bird came for ever to be associated with the goddess. (loc 2519)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Hestia&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>all the gods, Hestia – ‘First to be devoured and the last to be yielded up again’ – is probably the least well known to us, perhaps because the realm that Zeus in his wisdom apportioned to her was the hearth. In our less communal age of central heating and separate rooms for each family member, we do not lend the hearth quite the importance that our ancestors did, Greek or otherwise. (loc 819)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Romans, whose name for her was VESTA, considered her so important that they had a school of priestesses devoted to her, the celebrated Vestal Virgins. Their responsibility, aside from life-long celibacy, was to make sure that the flame representing her was never extinguished. They were the original guardians of the sacred flame. (loc 832)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Hades&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Hades also came to symbolize riches and opulence. (loc 855)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Romans called him PLUTO and words like ‘plutocrat’ and ‘plutonium’ tell of this great opulence and power. (loc 857)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Poseidon&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Under what we would now call the Aegean Sea, Poseidon built a vast palace of coral and pearl in which he installed himself and his chosen consort, AMPHITRITE, a daughter of Nereus and Doris, or (some say) of Oceanus and Tethys. As a wedding gift, Poseidon presented Amphitrite with the very first dolphin. She bore him a son, TRITON, a kind of merman, usually depicted sitting on his tail and blowing with bulging cheeks into a large conch shell. (loc 889)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Demeter&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So lovely was Demeter that she attracted the unwanted attention of her brothers Zeus and Poseidon. To avoid Poseidon she transformed herself into a mare, and to chase her he turned into a stallion. The issue of that union was a colt, ARION, who grew into an immortal horse magically endowed with the power of speech. By Zeus she had a daughter, PERSEPHONE, whose story comes along later. (loc 901)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Hephaestus – god of fire, and of blacksmiths, artisans, sculptors and metalworkers – was home. His Roman name is VULCAN, which lives on in volcanoes and vulcanized rubber. (loc 1018)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Athena&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Wisdom and insight were inherited from her mother, Metis. Handicraft, warcraft and statecraft were hers. Law and justice too. She took a share in what had been uniquely Aphrodite’s domains of love and beauty. Athena’s kind of beauty was expressed in aesthetics, in the apprehension of its ideal in art, representation, thought and character, rather than in the more physical, obvious and perhaps superficial kinds that would always be the business of Aphrodite. (loc 1164)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Athena’s simple gift was the first olive tree. (loc 1173)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Athena, like Demeter, remained untouched by man. Her childless, single life and her youthful relationship with Pallas have led some to maintain that she should stand as a symbol of feminine same-sex love. (loc 1191)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Apollo&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Leto named the child APOLLO. ‘Delian Apollo’, he was sometimes called in honour of his birthplace, and ‘Phoebus Apollo’ in deference to his Titaness grandmother and his own radiant, golden beauty, for Phoebus means ‘shining one’. (loc 1247)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Apollo was lord of mathematics, reason and logic. Poetry and medicine, knowledge, rhetoric and enlightenment were his realm. In essence he was the god of harmony. The idea that the base material world and its ordinary objects had divine properties and could resonate with the heavens, this was Apollonian, whether expressed in the magical properties of squares, circles and spheres or in the perfect modulation and rhythms of a voice or a chain of reasoning. (loc 1289)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Artemis&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The Romans called her DIANA. Her special tree was the cypress. Inasmuch as Athena was goddess of things cultivated, made, crafted and thought through, Artemis – in her dominion over the natural, instinctive and wild – stood as her opposite. They shared, however – along with Hestia – a passion for their own chastity. (loc 1283)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Artemis and Athena might be considered to represent opposites (wild v. cultivated, impulsive v. considered, etc.) so the mutability, swiftness and energetic impulses of traffic and exchange personified by Hermes might be said to present an exact counter to the serenity, permanence, order and centred domestic sufficiency of Hestia. (loc 1473)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Hermes&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>His light was not golden like Apollo’s, but silver – quicksilver. Indeed the element named ‘mercury’ after him is still sometimes called ‘quicksilver’, and all things mercurial remind us of this most delightful of gods. (loc 1478)</div></details></p>
<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Dionysius&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The Romans called him by the name BACCHUS and worshipped him quite as devotedly as did the Greeks. He was to stand in a kind of polar opposition to Apollo – one representing the golden light of reason, harmonious music, lyric poetry and mathematics, the other embodying the darker energies of disorder, liberation, wild music, bloodlust, frenzy and unreason. Of course the gods had living personalities and stories, and so they often strayed from such frozen symbolic identities. Apollo, as we shall see very soon, was himself capable of being bloody, crazed and cruel, while Dionysus could be more than just the embodiment of inebriation and debauchery. He was sometimes called ‘the Liberator’, a vegetal life-force whose licence could benevolently relieve and renew the world.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The vine leaf, the thyrsus – a staff topped with a pine cone – a chariot drawn by leopards or other exotic beasts, depraved attendants sporting roaring erections, jars flowing with wine – the Dionysiac Idea added much to the world. The importance of this new god was such that he simply had to be welcomed into Olympus. But there was already a full complement of twelve gods in residence and thirteen was, even then, looked on as an unlucky number. The gods scratched their chins and wondered what could be done. They wanted Dionysus – the truth was they liked him and the festive energy he brought to every gathering. And more than anything they liked the idea of wine being added to nectar, instead of fermented honey and plain fruit juice. (loc 3159)</p>

<p>From formless Chaos sprang two creations: EREBUS and NYX. Erebus, he was darkness, and Nyx, she was night. They coupled at once and the flashing fruits of their union were HEMERA, day, and AETHER, light. (loc 174)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>At the same time – because everything must happen simultaneously until Time is there to separate events – Chaos brought forth two more entities: GAIA, the earth, and TARTARUS, the depths and caves beneath the earth. (loc 176)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The silent emptiness of this world was filled when Gaia bore two sons all on her own. The first was PONTUS, the sea, and the second was OURANOS, (loc 184)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Right from the start, the union of Ouranos and Gaia was gratifyingly productive. Twelve robust, healthy children came first – six male, six female. The males were OCEANUS, COEUS, CRIUS, HYPERION, IAPETUS and KRONOS. The females, THEIA, THEMIS, MNEMOSYNE, PHOEBE, TETHYS and RHEA. (loc 200)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Gaia the Earth Mother was the same as gaia, the earth itself, just as ouranos, the sky, and Ouranos the Sky Father were one and the same. (loc 221)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Gaia went next to Theia, who was also paired off in another sibling union, to her brother Hyperion. In due course she would give birth to HELIOS the sun, SELENE the moon and EOS the dawn, (loc 256)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;The Titans&lt;/summary&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>From that blood, the blood which fell from the ruined groin of Ouranos, living beings emerged. (loc 397)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The first to push themselves out of the sodden ground were the ERINYES, whom we call the Furies, ALECTO (remorseless), MEGAERA (jealous rage) and TISIPHONE (vengeance). (loc 397)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Kronos was now lord of earth, sea and sky, with the scythe the symbol of his authority. His sceptre. The earth he took from Gaia, the sky from Ouranos. With threats of violence he wrested dominion over the sea from Pontus and Thalassa and from his siblings Oceanus and Tethys. (loc 461)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The bloody, violent and destructive conflict that followed is known to historians as the TITANOMACHY. (loc 638)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>His strongest and most violent opponent in the war had not been Kronos but ATLAS, the brutally powerful eldest son of Iapetus and Clymene. (loc 780)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In time he solidified into the Atlas Mountains that shoulder the skies of North Africa to this day. (loc 788)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To one side of him lies the Mediterranean and to the other the ocean still named ‘the Atlantic’ after him, (loc 790)</p>

<p>One of the original Titans, Mnemosyne (Memory), was mother by Zeus to nine highly intelligent and creative daughters, the Muses, who lived at various times on Mount Helicon (where the Hippocrene fountain later played), on Mount Parnassus above Delphi, and in Pieria in Thessaly where the Pierian Spring, the metaphorical source of all the arts and sciences, flowed.

<p>Sisyphus was a wicked, greedy, duplicitous and often cruel man, but who cannot find something appealing – heroic even – in the unquenchable zest and fist-shaking defiance with which he lived (in fact outlived) his life? Few mortals dared to try the patience of the gods in so reckless a fashion. (loc 3430)</p>

Thanatos will never visit you again.’ ‘That’s it?’ ‘That’s it,’ said Hermes. ‘Of course, if you don’t like the idea I can take you to Elysium, where you will spend a blissful eternity in the company of other souls of the virtuous departed. But if you choose the stone you must keep trying until you have succeeded and won your freedom and immortality. Make your choice. An idyllic afterlife down here or a shot at immortality above.’ (loc 3655)</p>

<p>Painters, poets and philosophers have seen many things in the myth of Sisyphus. They have seen an image of the absurdity of human life, the futility of effort, the remorseless cruelty of fate, the unconquerable power of gravity. But they have seen too something of mankind’s courage, resilience, fortitude, endurance and self-belief. They see something heroic in our refusal to submit. (loc 3671)</p>

One last little creature was left behind to beat its wings hopelessly in the jar for ever. Its name was ELPIS, Hope. (loc 1808)</p>

It was a joy that was to last for half the length of the year, for six months later, in accordance with ineluctable divine law, Persephone was forced to return to the underworld.

The eldest, HYGIEIA, he taught the practices of cleanliness, diet and physical exercise that are today named ‘hygiene’ after her. To PANACEA he revealed the arts of universal health, of medicinal preparation and the production of remedies and treatments that could heal anything – which is what her name means: ‘cure all’. ACESO he instructed in the healing process itself, including what we would now call immunology. The youngest girl IASO specialized in recovery and recuperation. (loc 3292)</p>

So much more than affectionate, so much less than spiritual, eros and the erotic can lead us to glory and to disgrace, to the highest pitch of happiness and the deepest pit of despair. PHILIA – the form of love applied to friendship, partiality and fondness. We see its traces in words like ‘francophile’, ‘necrophilia’ and ‘philanthropy’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big tech is stealing our focus]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Stolen Focus</em> is a well-intentioned book about a problem that many people struggle with: a lack of focus. Hari posits the comforting thesis that this focus is being “stolen” rather than being lost – it is not our fault, rather it is a systemic issue propagated by big tech.</p>
<p>I think there are valuable insights in the book and I find myself agreeing with many of the individual things he writes. But I just don’t think he makes a solid enough case.</p>
<p>Hari commits one of Nietzche’s “great errors”: confusing cause and consequence (or at the very least being sloppy with cause and consequence). Each chapter title is styled as a “cause” for the loss in attention but it’s hard to argue that all the factors are causal, particularly the chapters regarding Sleep, Reading and Dieting – these seem more like consequences or corollaries of a loss in attention. While this criticism may sound like semantic nitpicking, I think it matters quite a lot: by presenting so many “causes”, Hari creates artificial strength for an argument, when really he has a scattering of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>Perhaps more fundamentally (to Hari’s credit, he points this out), the structure of the argument is weird: he admits that there is no actual evidence that our attention is getting worse, but instead suggests that it is reasonable to assume so given that a lot of factors known to diminish attention are increasing. As I argued above, it’s not obvious that these factors are indeed “known” to causally diminish attention, and even if they did, whether that is suitable justification for the book’s core thesis. So what is left behind? A weird list of “bad things” that are happening to us, all loosely linked to the subject of attention, focus and productivity. The somewhat bizarre chapter on Diet is a case in point. Though I have come to similar conclusions to him (broadly speaking: processed foods are bad), he presents weak evidence from cherry-picked “experts” (a nutritionist rather than a dietician) and makes hopelessly unsubstantiated claims regarding their effect on attention. I think we have a good reason to be especially sceptical given the author’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Hari#2011_Plagiarism_and_fabrication_scandal">known history</a> of being loose with facts.</p>
<p>The best-argued parts of the book were those on the incentive structures of Big Tech (well covered in Netflix’s <em>The Social Dilemma</em> ) and the debate on systemic vs individual responsibility. Hari is very much of the opinion that it is a systemic issue and is vicious towards people like Nir Eyal (author of <a href="/?books=hooked" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Hooked</a>) who emphasise the role of personal responsibility. I see some amusing hypocrisy here: he is judgmental of Eyal, a product of the system, because Eyal is judgmental of individuals, products of the system. That aside, I do land on the side of Eyal – I think individual responsibility is quite important (though it’s not a true dichotomy) but this might say more about my Darwinian worldview than anything else. But since Hari talks so much about incentive structures, I guess it’s worth considering his own incentive structures. Which is going to be more popular, a book that says “it’s your fault” or a book that says “it’s not your fault”?</p>
<p>I was quite open-minded to Hari’s suggested solutions: they are intriguing and radical. For example, turning social media into a public utility (a la BBC) and banning the business model of data-driven advertising, such that Facebook would become a subscription product. In theory, this would align incentives since the platform would be trying to create value for users. I don’t think these solutions are “hopelessly naive” but I do think they ignore a relatively important fact: Big Tech has created a lot of value. Perhaps giving up personal data (and even some focus?) is a fair trade in exchange for the marvels of free software like Google Maps and Gmail. Nevertheless, this part of the book highlighted to me how cynical and fatalist I had previously been:</p>
<p>Overall the book is a well-meaning and accessible review of some basic ideas surrounding attention, like Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s <a href="/?books=flow-the-psychology-of-optimal-experience" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>. Hari outlines several areas of our lives that we should probably pay attention to (diet, sleep, stress, air pollution, reading, mind-wandering etc), discusses some valid criticisms of Big Tech, and proposes some bold solutions. But as for the core thesis, the book falls flat.</p>

<p>The truth is that you are living in a system that is pouring acid on your attention every day, and then you are being told to blame yourself and to fiddle with your own habits while the world’s attention burns. (loc 184)</p>

<p>To grow and flourish to its full potential, your focus needs certain things to be present: play for children and flow states for adults, to read books, to discover meaningful activities that you want to focus on, to have space to let your mind wander so you can make sense of your life, to exercise, to sleep properly, to eat nutritious food that makes it possible for you to develop a healthy brain, and to have a sense of safety. And there are certain things you need to protect your attention from, because they will sicken or stunt it: too much speed, too much switching, too much stimuli, intrusive technology designed to hack and hook you, stress, exhaustion, processed food pumped with dyes that amp you up, polluted air. (loc 4138)</p>

<p>at many points in history, people have thought they were experiencing some kind of disastrous social decline, when in fact, they were merely ageing. It’s always tempting to confuse your personal decline for the decline of the human species. (loc 440)</p>

<p>With almost every data set they looked at, the pattern was the same. Sune said: ‘We looked at a lot of different systems … and we see that in every system, there is an accelerating trend.’ It is ‘faster to reach peak popularity’, and then there is ‘a faster drop again’. (loc 454)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>we told ourselves we could have a massive expansion in the amount of information we are exposed to, and the speed at which it hits us, with no costs. This is a delusion: ‘It becomes exhausting.’ More importantly, Sune said, ‘What we are sacrificing is depth in all sorts of dimensions … Depth takes time. And depth takes reflection. If you have to keep up with everything and send emails all the time, there’s no time to reach depth. (loc 487)</p>

<p>the most persuasive answer [to why we have been accelerating] came from the Norwegian scientist Thomas Hylland Eriksen, who is a professor of social anthropology. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, he said, our economies have been built around a new and radical idea – economic growth. This is the belief that every year, the economy – and each individual company in it – should get bigger and bigger. [...]</p>
<p>that growth can happen in one of two ways. The first is that a corporation can find new markets – by inventing something new, or exporting something to a part of the world that doesn’t have it yet. The second is that a corporation can persuade existing consumers to consume more. (loc 4223)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The scientists investigating this also discovered that if you make people read quickly, they are much less likely to grapple with complex or challenging material. They start to prefer simplistic statements. (loc 523)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There’s one key fact, he said, that every human being needs to understand – and everything else he was going to explain flows from that. ‘Your brain can only produce one or two thoughts’ in your conscious mind at once. That’s it. ‘We’re very, very single-minded.’ We have ‘very limited cognitive capacity’. (loc 561)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The study found that ‘technological distraction’ – just getting emails and calls – caused a drop in the workers’ IQ by an average of ten points. (loc 589)</p>

<p>It’s another thing to hear one of the leading neuroscientists in the world tell you we are living in a ‘perfect storm’ that’s degrading your capacity to think. ‘The best we can do now,’ Earl had told me, ‘is try to get rid of the distractions as much as possible.’ (loc 645)</p>

<p>Years later, the designers of Instagram asked: If we reinforce our users for taking selfies – if we give them hearts and likes – will they start to do it obsessively, just like the pigeon will obsessively hold out its left wing to get extra seed?

<p>in Chicago, [Mihaly] persuaded a group of painters to let him witness their process over many months, so he could try to figure out the underlying psychological processes that were driving the unusual kind of focus they had chosen to dedicate their lives to. (loc 801)</p>

<p>If Skinner was right – that human beings do things just to gain rewards and avoid punishments – this made no sense. You’d done the work; now here’s the reward, right in front of you, for you to enjoy. But creative people seemed mostly uninterested in rewards; even money didn’t interest most of them. (loc 808)</p>

<p>if human beings drill down in the right way, we can hit a gusher of focus inside ourselves – a long surge of attention that will flow forth and carry us through difficult tasks in a way that feels painless, and in fact pleasurable. (loc 830)</p>

<p>we all have a choice now between two profound forces – fragmentation, or flow. Fragmentation makes you smaller, shallower, angrier. Flow makes you bigger, deeper, calmer. Fragmentation shrinks us. Flow expands us. I asked myself – do you want to be one of Skinner’s pigeons, atrophying your attention on dancing for crude rewards, or Mihaly’s painters, able to concentrate because you have found something that really matters?

<p>We evolved to get a rush of energy – a ‘surge of waking drive’, Charles says – when the sun began to set. This was very helpful to our ancestors. Imagine you’re out camping, and the sun starts to fall – it’s very useful if you then feel a rush of wakefulness, because then you’ll be able to set up your tent before it’s too dark to do it. In the same way, our ancestors got a fresh rush of energy just as the light waned so they could safely get back to their tribe and finish the things they needed to do that day. (loc 1130)</p>

<p>The way our tech works now to corrode our attention was and remains a choice – by Silicon Valley, and by the wider society that lets them do it.

<p>‘cruel optimism’. This is when you take a really big problem with deep causes in our culture – like obesity, or depression, or addiction – and you offer people, in upbeat language, a simplistic individual solution. It sounds optimistic, because you are telling them that the problem can be solved, and soon – but it is, in fact, cruel, because the solution you are offering is so limited, and so blind to the deeper causes, that for most people, it will fail.

<p>I am in favour of each individual piece of advice he offers. You really should take out your phone now and turn off your notifications. You really should figure out your internal triggers. And on, and on. (Tristan believes this too).

<p>The alternative to cruel optimism – telling people a simplistic story that sets them up to fail – isn’t pessimism, the idea that you can’t change anything. It’s authentic optimism.

<p>Sendhil Mullainathan, professor of computational science at the University of Chicago. He was part of a team that studied sugarcane harvesters in India.

<p>Finland decided to stop talking and actually try it. They selected 2,000 of their citizens at random, aged between twenty-five and fifty-eight, and told them: for the next two years, every month, we’re going to give you 560 euros (which is about $650 US, or £500), no strings attached. The government set up alongside it a rigorous scientific programme to see what happened next, and once the project was over, the results were published. I interviewed two of the lead scientists who worked on it: Olavi Kangas, who is a professor in the Department of Social Research at the University of Turku, and Dr Signe Jauhilinen, and they talked me through their findings.</p>
<p>once people received a basic income, their ability to focus improved significantly. Signe said they couldn’t figure out the exact reason why, but they found that ‘problems with money are really not good for concentration … If you have to worry about your financial situation … it takes a lot of the capacity of your brain. If you don’t have to worry, then it improves your capacity to think about other things.’</p>
<p>Finland showed that a universal basic income – enough to give a baseline of security, but not so much that it disincentivises work – improves people’s focus by dealing with one of the causes of our hypervigilance. (loc 2751)</p>

<p>The threat of being beaten up or killed is surely the largest source of stress any person can face. Since that has fallen, we would expect this trend to have improved attention and focus. (loc 2770)</p>

<p>As you saw in the introduction, I believe it is reasonable to argue that our attention problems are getting worse, even though we don’t have any long-term studies tracking changes in people’s ability to focus over time. I came to this conclusion because we can prove that there are several factors that damage focus and attention, and those factors are rising. But there’s one counterargument to that. [that other mitigating factors are also rising] (loc 2761)</p>

<p>When the problem [leaded petrol] was blamed on isolated individuals, and they were told to solve it by simply tweaking their own behaviour, the problem only got worse. So I investigated – what did end it? I learned it was one thing, and one thing only. It stopped when ordinary citizens learned the scientific evidence and banded together to demand their governments change the law to stop these companies from poisoning them. In Britain, for example, the campaign against leaded petrol was led by a housewife named Jill Runnette, who succeeded in getting the government to cut the amount of lead in petrol by two-thirds in 1981. (It was later banned altogether.) She did it to protect herself and the children of her society. (loc 3151)</p>

<p>in 2009 a team of Dutch scientists took a group of twenty-seven children who had been identified as having trouble focusing, and they split them into two groups. Fifteen of them were assigned to an ‘eliminationist’ diet, which meant they couldn’t consume the junk most of us eat every day – preservatives, additives, synthetic dyes – and so instead they had to eat the kind of food my grandparents would have recognised. The other twelve carried on eating the usual Western diet. The team then monitored them for several weeks to see what happened. It turned out that more than 70 percent of the kids who cut out the preservatives and dyes improved their ability to pay attention, and the average improvement was a remarkable 50 percent.

<p>In the late 1960s, a group of Massachusetts parents who were unhappy with their kids’ schooling decided to do something that sounds, at first glance, quite mad. They opened a school that would have no teachers, no classes, no curriculum, no homework and no tests. One of the founders told me their goal was to create a completely new model, from scratch, of how a school could be. It left out almost everything we think of as schooling. More than fifty years later, I arrived at their creation. It is named Sudbury Valley School, and from the outside, it looks like a raddled Downton Abbey – a big, roomy, old-fashioned mansion, surrounded by woods and barns and creeks.

Between the ages of seven and sixteen, kids arrive at school at 9 a.m. and leave at 2 p.m. They are given almost no homework, and they sit almost no tests until they graduate from high school. Free play is at the beating heart of Finnish kids’ lives: by law, teachers have to give kids fifteen minutes of free play for every forty-five minutes of instruction. What’s the outcome? Only 0.1 percent of their kids are diagnosed with attention problems, and Finns are among the most literate, numerate and happy people in the world. (loc 3972)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Military incompetence is not driven by stupidity, but by child psychology]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>On the Psychology of Military Incompetence</em> takes us through the past few centuries of British military catastrophes, outlining the failures of leadership that led to several humiliating defeats and unimaginable amounts of human suffering. More so it deconstructs the personality traits of the generals and speculates on the psychological basis of these traits with reference to psychoanalytic theory.</p>
<p>Some of the ineptitude borders on the unbelievable; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rblfKREj50o">General Melchert</a> in <em>Blackadder Goes Forth</em> (Stephen Fry’s character) seems to be far more competent than the typical commander in the book. Unlike the writers of Blackadder, however, Dixon is by no means trying to make a caricature of the generals. On the contrary, he makes every effort to give them the benefit of the doubt: highlighting, for instance, that the British Navy’s continued reluctance to adopt innovations (like changing the hulls from wood to iron) saved the taxpayer great expense, albeit at the probable cost of many lives. Yet even the most ardent supporters of the military couldn’t deny the magnitude of some of the failures involved.</p>
<p>For that reason, the book often made me sad. The needless loss of life due to pure incompetence – the contrast between the bravery and self-sacrifice of the soldiers and the generals who blunder’d (<em>The Charge of the Light Brigade</em> ). Dixon outlines how pride, jealousy, irrationality, and a lack of accountability combined to create unimaginable amounts of suffering. For instance, a complete lack of logistics in the Siege of Kut led to disease and mass starvation among the British troops. Fortunately, Dixon balances out the bleakness with several classic one-liners:</p>

<p>In Part 2, the book threads history with psychology, exploring both the individual complexes of the inept generals and the organisational psychology that leads to collective incompetence. He argues that military organisations select for the personality traits that create poor leaders (though the traits may be beneficial for common soldiers); specifically, the military selects for Authoritarian personality types. This leads to, among other things: an inability to accept contradicting information, an urge to be in a position of power, and overall poor decision-making.</p>
<p>The Fall of Singapore is one of the best case studies (though this is slightly biased by my upbringing); it is a clear example of the inadequacy of the “Bloody Fool Theory”, for General Percival was highly intelligent. Yet despite his IQ, he was comically inept, refusing to build North-facing defences because doing so would supposedly lower morale. Instead, he continued to fortify the sea-facing defences, leaving Singapore completely unprepared for a land invasion from – who could have guessed – the North.</p>
<p>The psychology angle of the book is fascinating, but it does remind me of the classic criticisms regarding the pseudoscientific nature of psychoanalysis. The author finds many examples that support his thesis and its contrapositive (i.e. incompetent authoritarians and competent non-authoritarians) but seems to allocate little effort to exploring exceptions. Nevertheless, I think the book is useful even if one does not accept all the psychoanalysis: the discussion of the common traits of bad generals is incisive, even if one places little weight on Dixon’s speculation regarding the psychoanalytic <em>origins</em> of such behaviours. For my part, I find the psychoanalytical arguments compelling, if not strong enough to be predictive.</p>
<p>Lastly, though lengthy, the book is a pleasure to read. It is beautifully English, dripping with dry wit and revelling in deliberate anglo-centrism. Nobody can criticise the British like the British!</p>

<p>The leaders of such armies were chosen from corps of officers who were not recruited primarily for prowess or intelligence, but because they conformed to certain social criteria. They, for instance, had to be noble, or to profess a certain religion, or, where nobility was not a passport to rank, to belong to the appropriate class or caste. This is why successful generals when they emerge appear to be freaks or mavericks; (loc 88)</p>

<p>Military ineptitude in the light of five inescapable, if unfortunate, features of human psychology. These are: 1. Man shares with lower animals certain powerful instincts. 2. Unlike lower animals, most men learn to control, frustrate, direct and sublimate these instinctual energies. 3. While by far the largest part of this learning occurs in early childhood, its effects upon the adult personality are profound and long-lasting. 4. Residues of this early learning, and in particular unresolved conflicts between infantile desires and the demands of punitive morality, may remain wholly unconscious yet provide a canker of inexhaustible anxiety. 5. When this anxiety becomes the driving force in life’s endeavours, the fragile edifices of reason and competence are placed in jeopardy. (loc 268)</p>

<p>The least competent should have a personality which manifests profound disturbance of the ego, rigidity, dogmatism and fear-of-failure motivation. Conversely, the striking characteristics of highly competent commanders should be their absence of authoritarian psychopathology, enormous self-confidence and general robustness of the ego. (loc 5497)</p>

<p>good generals differ from bad not in their age, colour or intelligence, but in the degree to which they are able to resist the psychopathology of the organizations in which they serve. (loc 5300)</p>
<p><em>The best are able to get in accordance not just with their own complex (Freud), but those of the parent organisation.</em></p>

<p>military leaders like Deverell, Montgomery-Massingberd, Milne, Ironside and Gort displayed behaviour symptomatic of extremely weak egos. In this light, their behaviour typifies the neurotic paradox in which the individual’s need to be loved breeds, on the one hand, an insatiable desire for admiration with avoidance of criticism, and, on the other, an equally devouring urge for power and positions of dominance. (loc 1865)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There is, it seems, a recurring pattern to military mishaps which defies any explanation in terms of the ‘bloody fool’ theory. (loc 6923)</p>

<p>nature and effects of militarism have more than coincidental similarity to those psychological defences which individuals erect against personal anxieties. These have to do with sex, dirt, aggression, self-esteem and death. Not very surprisingly, a military career attracts a minority of people with these sorts of anxieties. (loc 6928)</p>
<p>Once there, however, they become incapacitated by the very characteristics which hastened their ascent. These traits – need for approval, fear of failure, being deaf to unpalatable information, and the rest – are probably accentuated by their larger responsibilities, and the fact that there is now no longer anyone higher up to whom they might appeal. (loc 6933)</p>

<p>By the end of the Second World War we knew a great deal about the nature of leadership on the level of pilots and platoon commanders. But no one so far has had the temerity to apply the same criteria to generals, and this is why I think Norman Dixon’s book is by way of being a landmark. (loc 115)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>‘In a situation where the consequences of wrong decisions are so awesome, where a single bit of irrationality can set a whole train of traumatic events in motion, I do not think that we can be satisfied with the assurance that “most people behave rationally most of the time”.’ C. E. OSGOOD (loc 314)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Senior commanders have often to fill a number of incompatible roles. According to Morris Janowitz these include ‘heroic’ leader, military manager and technocrat. To these we would add politician, public relations man, father-figure and psychotherapist. (loc 338)</p>
<p><em>Being a general is an exceedingly tough role.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>‘New’ information has, by definition, high informational content, and therefore firstly it will require greater processing capacity, secondly it threatens a return to an earlier state of gnawing uncertainty, and thirdly it confronts the decision-maker with the nasty thought that he may have been wrong. No wonder he tends to turn a blind eye! (loc 363)</p>
<p><em>There are understandable (if not rational) reasons to avoid new information.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>‘fog of war’, unlike the uncertainties which attach to most civilian enterprises, extends not only to the input but also to the pay-offs. (loc 380)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the military leader possesses constitutional power of a magnitude which surpasses that of leaders in most other human groups. If he cannot pull his followers by force of character, he can at least push them by force of law. (loc 3636)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>two roles of a leader: ‘task specialist’ and ‘social specialist’. As task specialist a leader’s prime concern is to achieve the group’s ostensible goal; in the case of the military, defeating the enemy. For such a role, being likeable is a rather less important trait than that of being more active, more intelligent and better informed than his followers. In his capacity as ‘social specialist’, however, a leader’s main function is to preserve good personal relations within the group, thereby so maintaining morale as to keep the group in being. In the military milieu the function of a successful social specialist would prevent mutiny and reduce such symptoms of low morale as absenteeism, desertion, sickness and crime. Not very surprisingly, the most important attribute of such a leader is that he should be liked. (loc 3653)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>leadership depends upon a proper understanding of the needs and opinions of those one hopes to lead, and the context in which the leadership occurs. It also depends on good timing. Hitler, who was neither omniscient, trustworthy nor sincere, whose stature was unremarkable and whose appearance verged on the repellent, understood these rules and exploited them to full advantage.

<p>the Crimean War certainly marked an exceedingly low point in British military history. The poor quality of the officers, most of whom had bought their commissions and for whom no standard of education was required, stood in marked contrast to the excellence of the men, described by one observer as ‘the finest soldiers I ever saw in stature, physique and appearance’. (loc 456)</p>

<p>Lack of direction from those at the apex of a hierarchical authoritarian organization provides a special dilemma for those at lower levels in the chain of command. Confronted with an absence of clear-cut orders, what are they to do? If they take the law into their own hands they run the risk of being accused of insubordination, particularly if their plans happen to miscarry, but if they do not show initiative then they are equally likely to suffer for not having done so.

<p>It is a sad feature of authoritarian organizations that their nature inevitably militates against the possibility of learning from experience through the apportioning of blame. The reason is not hard to find. Since authoritarianism is itself the product of psychological defences, authoritarian organizations are past masters at deflecting blame. (loc 583)</p>

<p>The transition from the old smooth-bore ‘Brown Besses’ (later replaced by Minié rifles) of the Crimean War to the high-powered, rapid-firing rifles, using smokeless powder, that were available by 1890 constituted what is probably the single greatest advance in fire power since the invention of gunpowder.

<p>there are remarkable parallels between this lapse and the events which preceded the fall of Singapore in 1942. In both cases the generals in charge were responsible for the safety of an English civilian population.

And in both cases they lacked the imagination to carry out the most elementary and obvious of precautions. (loc 901)</p>

<p>The British retreat from Kabul in the First Afghan War has been described by Field-Marshal Sir Gerald Templer as ‘the most disgraceful and humiliating episode in our history of war against an Asian enemy up to that time’. (loc 1086)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>in 1842 a British army was stationed in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, for the purpose of supporting the puppet ruler Shah Soojah. This unwise move was motivated by the belief that without a pro-British ruler in Afghanistan that country and then India might be lost to Russia. (loc 1090)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>By the orders of the commanding officer, Willoughby Cotton, the army’s commissariat stores were constructed a quarter of a mile outside the cantonment. The consequences of this decision were tragic and inevitable. When the Afghans finally rose against the British, the army were promptly cut off from their supplies. Thus it was that under the threat of starvation they ultimately capitulated to Akbar Kahn, the Afghan leader, and began the retreat which cost them all their lives. (loc 1114)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Throughout this pitiful venture, Elphinstone, despite the trail of corpses which lay behind him, retained a pathetic and wholly unjustified faith in the Afghan leader’s promise of safe conduct. By the end of the fifth day the total losses of soldiers and civilians had risen to 12,000. As one officer described it: ‘There was literally a continuous lane of poor wretches, men, women, and children dead or dying from the cold and wounds who, unable to move, entreated their comrades to kill them and put an end to their misery.’ (loc 1178)</p>

<p>‘Market-Garden’ was a two-stage operation. In the first stage a massive airborne drop on northern Holland was timed to coincide with the invasion of southern Holland by land forces of British 2nd Army. In the second stage the paratroops and glider-borne forces of 1st Airborne Division were to capture and hold the great road bridge at Arnhem while the tanks of 2nd Army’s XXX Corps raced across Holland to consolidate their gains.

<p>At long last the General Officer Commanding Malaya [Percival] gave his answer. ‘I believe that defences of the sort you want to throw up are bad for the morale of troops and civilians.’ As Barber comments: ‘Simson was “frankly horrified” and remembers standing there in the room suddenly feeling quite cold, and realizing that, except for a miracle, Singapore was as good as lost.

<p>Of all the instances of military incompetence considered in this book, it is the fall of Singapore which most clearly gives the lie to the so-called ‘bloody fool’ theory of military ineptitude.

What he shared with other, earlier, military incompetents were passivity and courtesy, rigidity and obstinacy, procrastination, gentleness and dogmatism. (loc 2380)</p>

<p>Pontification is one of the ways in which people try to resolve their dissonance.

<p>Cognitive dissonance, pontification, denial, risk-taking and anti-intellectualism are all, in reality, more concerned with emotion than with intelligence. The susceptibility to cognitive dissonance, the tendency to pontificate and the inability to adjust the riskiness of decisions to the real situation are a product of such neurotic disabilities as extreme anxiety under stress, low self-esteem, nervousness, the need for approval and general defensiveness. These, it seems, over and above his level of intelligence, are the factors which interfere with what a man decides to do in a given situation. (loc 2767)</p>

<p>Upon closer analysis, however, it seems that in their failure to fulfil the primary function of a commander, the culprits fall into two categories. First there are those like Elphinstone, Raglan, Buller and Percival: mild, courteous and peaceful men who, though no doubt caring deeply about the fearful losses which their armies suffered, seemed quite incapable of ameliorating the situation. (loc 2536)</p>
<p>they stood in sharp contrast to those of a second group whose besetting sin was overweening ambition coupled with a terrifying insensitivity to the suffering of others. These, men like Haig, Townshend, Walpole, Nixon and Joffre, seemed dedicated to one goal – self-advancement. (loc 2548)</p>

<p>It was a common clinical observation during the war that military service was an unusually good environment for men who lacked inner controls … The combination of absolute security, a strong institutional parent-substitute on whom one could lean unobtrusively, and socially approved outlets for aggression provided a form of social control that allowed impulses to be expressed in acceptable ways.

<p>The precise details of the process whereby babies – disorderly, demanding, self-indulgent and incontinent – are turned into clean, dry, socially responsible adults is still a matter for debate. According to psycho-analytic theory, between the ages of one and five years the fear of losing parental affection, together with the threat of other dire consequences, moves the child towards renunciation of old habits for some rather bleak new ones. The latter reflect the standards of the society into which he has been born. (loc 3155)</p>

<p>Milgram asked the question: If a man is ordered by a person in authority to deliver increasingly severe electric shocks to a helpless victim, how far will he go before disobeying the order? The findings were alarming. They indicated that ordinary decent men could be so seduced by the trappings of authority that they would continue delivering shocks up to 450 volts (marked ‘DANGER – severe shock’ on the control panel), and this even when hearing the agonized shrieks of the ‘helpless victim’ whom they could dimly see behind a sheet of silvered glass. This readiness to obey, even when the consequence of obedience was an act of outrageous inhumanity, was significantly greater in authoritarian personalities than others. (loc 4621)</p>

<p>From the foregoing two chapters, ‘authoritarianism’, with its associated traits of anal-obsessiveness and the ‘closed mind’, emerges as the final product of a massive and largely unconscious conflict between two opposing forces. On one side are ranged the powerful drives of sex and aggression, and on the other the strictures of a bourgeois morality implanted in the child by his status-anxious parents. The conflict is chronic and its effect upon mind and behaviour restrictive to the point of being crippling. From this we have argued that the psychology of authoritarianism lies at the heart of much military incompetence. Because organizations which are invested with the task of managing a nation’s violence develop devices for controlling aggression, they will tend to attract into their ranks people with similar personal problems of control. Such people will tend to be conformist, conventional and over-controlled. They will also tend to seek approval, enjoy occupying a position in a dominance-submission hierarchy, and derive satisfaction from the provision of legitimate outlets for their normally repressed aggression. They are, in short, authoritarian. (loc 4940)</p>

Percival’s extraordinary refusal to prepare defences in Johore and the north of Singapore island answers this description.

The retreat from Kabul, the Third Battle of Ypres, the foolhardiness of Admiral Phillips which resulted in the loss of the two capital ships from air attack, and the behaviour of Townshend which culminated in the disastrous siege of Kut, could be taken to exemplify this particular defence against being branded a failure.

<p>like many of the other commanders on our list Napoleon was without that vanity which betokens a weak ego, was notoriously careless about his dress, had a wide range of intellectual interests, and promoted his subordinates on the basis of their efficiency. (loc 5786)</p>

<p>Of his generalship Liddell Hart wrote: ‘Lawrence can bear comparison with Marlborough or Napoleon in that vital faculty of generalship, the power of grasping instantly the picture of the ground and situation, of relating the one to the other, and the local to the general. Indeed there is much to suggest that his topographical and geographical sense was more remarkable than theirs.’ (loc 5863)</p>

<p>he did not manifest that ‘fear of failure’ which has hampered weaker men. He did not shun publicity and shelter behind a protective cloak of secrecy.

<p>the Israeli Army is civilianized and free of obsolete army tradition. It had, until recently, no time for ‘bull’, retaining only such military conventions as are minimally necessary for discipline and efficiency. (loc 6087)</p>

<p>Officers are often called by their first names amongst their men, as amongst their colleagues; there is very little saluting; there are a lot of unshaven chins; there are no outward signs of respect for superiors; there is no word in Hebrew for ‘Sir’. (loc 6093)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the forces of Israel are also free of that crippling anti-intellectualism and curious anti-feminism which have been such a feature of other military organizations. They are not a refuge for the dim nor a place where ‘butch’ young men can ‘prove’ their virility. (loc 6124)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Since the Israeli Army puts a low premium on obsessive behaviour, its administration tends to be disorderly: letters get lost, forms are wrongly filed, (loc 6127)</p>
<p><em>Discipline doesn’t necessitate rigidity, though the two are often related.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The other, related problem is that from time to time officers and N.C.O.s are charged with the ‘scandalous offence’ of imposing ‘bull’ upon the men. (loc 6130)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Even in Israel, it seems, the management of intra-species aggression tends to excite anal-obsessive defences in people who are perhaps naturally inclined that way. The difference between our army and theirs is that an inhibitory trait which we applaud is regarded by them as little short of a disaster for military efficiency. (loc 6133)</p>

<p>Montgomery’s generalship was marred by the effects of his unhappy childhood. Like Lawrence, Churchill and Curzon, Montgomery showed the effects of a poor relationship with his mother. In his case, the combination of too little affection and too much discipline seems to have eventuated in an insatiable need to prove himself, a desire to create the happy family life (symbolized by his staff of young liaison officers) which he had lacked as a child, and a tendency, as far as his superiors were concerned, to keep things to himself.

<p>Kitchener, who became Secretary of State in the First World War, had, according to Philip Magnus, ‘two basic attributes – an unparalleled thoroughness and an unparalleled drive’ He was ‘an individualist of great conceptions, whose hard and selfish nature was capable, at times, of kindness, sympathy and even affection’. These traits – his excessive drive (Lord Curzon once described Kitchener as ‘this molten mass of devouring energy’), his individualism and refusal to conform, the originality of his thinking, and the occasional flashes of underlying warmth and generosity, are hard to reconcile with the notion of authoritarianism.

<p>His diary and dispatches suggest that he was unemotional and totally anti-intraceptive (i.e., not one to reflect upon his own motives). He was manifestly lacking in compassion towards his fellow men.

By far the greatest of the three, Montgomery, was also the least authoritarian, and by far the most controversial, Haig, was certainly the most authoritarian. Kitchener lies somewhere between them on both counts. (loc 6885)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBS professor explores drivers of happiness. Invest in relationships!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>How Will You Measure Your Life</em>, renowned HBS professor Clayton Christensen (of <em>Innovator’s Dilemma</em> fame) explores happiness and fulfilment. The core thesis is that most people, even the most intelligent and ambitious people in the world (or perhaps them <em>especially</em> ), don’t adequately strategise about their long-term happiness, leading to lives that may be full of successes on paper but underneath are swimming in regret.</p>
<p>Each chapter outlines a particular area of life that Christensen feels is important (e.g, career choice, parenting, integrity), and provides a relevant management theory, along with a business case to illustrate its use, and many personal anecdotes to support the application of the theory to personal lives.</p>
<p>I was worried that the book would be a variety of cringeworthy applications of management theories to personal life – loose analogies rather than applicable mental models. This is somewhat true in the second half of the book as Christensen explores marriage and parenting, but generally, the theories seem useful and well-chosen, especially in the context of job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Christensen’s book is an important read for young ambitious people because it highlights an unpleasant possible future world: one in which you achieve the things that you currently want, but end up deeply unhappy because you’ve been optimising under a misspecified utility function.</p>

<p>Humans have been pondering the reason for our existence for thousands of years. What is new, however, is how some modern thinkers address the problem. A bevy of so-called experts simply offer the answers. (loc 148)</p>

<p>The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the fastest reward. That’s a dangerous way to build a strategy. (loc 297)</p>

<p>to maximize the value of the advice in this book, you must have a purpose in your life. For that reason, I want to describe to you the best process I know to develop a purpose, and illustrate it with the example of how I used this process in my own life. Mine was a rigorous process, and I recommend it to you as well. (loc 2353)</p>

<p>A useful statement of purpose for a company needs three parts. The first is what I will call a likeness. By analogy, a master painter often will create a pencil likeness that he has seen in his mind, before he attempts to create it in oils. A likeness of a company is what the key leaders and employees want the enterprise to have become at the end of the path that they are on. (loc 2357)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Second, for a purpose to be useful, employees and executives need to have a deep commitment—almost a conversion—to the likeness that they are trying to create. (loc 2362)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The third part of a company’s purpose is one or a few metrics by which managers and employees can measure their progress. (loc 2366)</p>

<p>When people ask me something, I now rarely answer directly. Instead, I run the question through a theory in my own mind, so I know what the theory says is likely to be the result of one course of action, compared to another. I’ll then explain how it applies to their question. To be sure they understand it, I’ll describe to them how the process in the model worked its way through an industry or situation different from their own, to help them visualize how it works. People, typically, then say, “Okay, I get it.” They’ll then answer their question with more insight than I could possibly have. (loc 176)</p>

<p>The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. —Steve Jobs (loc 254)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There are a determined few who never lose sight of aspiring to do something that’s truly meaningful to them. But for many of us, as the years go by, we allow our dreams to be peeled away. We pick our jobs for the wrong reasons and then we settle for them. (loc 263)</p>
<p><em>We have a large activation energy and status quo bias that prevent us from optimising effectively.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The answer lies in a deep chasm about how the concepts of incentives and motivation relate to each other. There are two broad camps on this question. (loc 364)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Back in 1976, two economists, Michael Jensen and William Meckling, published a paper that has been committed to memory by those in the first camp. The paper, which has been one of the most widely cited of the past three decades, focused on a problem known as agency theory, or incentive theory: why don’t managers always behave in a way that is in the best interest of shareholders? The root cause, as Jensen and Meckling saw it, is that people work in accordance with how you pay them. The takeaway was that you have to align the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders. (loc 365)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The problem with principal-agent, or incentives, theory is that there are powerful anomalies that it cannot explain. For example, some of the hardest-working people on the planet are employed in nonprofits and charitable organizations. (loc 382)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Two-factor theory, or motivation theory [...] turns the incentive theory on its head. It acknowledges that you can pay people to want what you want—over and over again. But incentives are not the same as motivation. True motivation is getting people to do something because they want to do it. (loc 392)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Herzberg notes the common assumption that job satisfaction is one big continuous spectrum—starting with very happy on one end and reaching all the way down to absolutely miserable on the other—is not actually the way the mind works. Instead, satisfaction and dissatisfaction are separate, independent measures. This means, for example, that it’s possible to love your job and hate it at the same time (loc 398)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Even those engaged in careers that seem to specifically focus on money, like salespeople and traders, are subject to these rules of motivation—it’s just that in these professions, money acts as a highly accurate yardstick of success. Traders, for example, feel success and are motivated by being able to predict what is going to happen in the world and then making bets based on those predictions. Being right is almost directly correlated with making money; it is the confirmation that they are doing their jobs well, the measure they use to compete on. (loc 458)</p>
<p><em>This is the best explanation I’ve found for why money matters to me.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>People who truly love what they do and who think their work is meaningful have a distinct advantage when they arrive at work every day. They throw their best effort into their jobs, and it makes them very good at what they do. This, in turn, can mean they get paid well; careers that are filled with motivators are often correlated with financial rewards. (loc 493)</p>

<p>When you put in place a plan focused on these anticipated opportunities, you are pursuing a deliberate strategy. (loc 554)</p>
<p>The decision sometimes is an explicit decision; often, however, a modified strategy coalesces from myriad day-to-day decisions to pursue unanticipated opportunities and resolve unanticipated problems. When strategy forms in this way, it is known as emergent strategy. (loc 560)</p>

<p>ask the project teams to compile a list of all the assumptions that have been made in those initial projections. Then ask them: “Which of these assumptions need to prove true in order for us to realistically expect that these numbers will materialize?” The assumptions on this list should be rank-ordered by importance and uncertainty. At the top of the list should be the assumptions that are most important and least certain, while the bottom of the list should be those that are least important and most certain. (loc 695)</p>

<p>As recounted in our book <em>Disrupting Class</em> , two researchers, Todd Risley and Betty Hart, studied the effects of how parents talk to a child during the first two and a half years of life.</p>
<p>If you add that up over the first thirty months, the child of “talkative” parents heard an estimated 48 million words spoken, compared to the disadvantaged child, who heard only 13 million. The most important time for the children to hear the words, the research suggests, is the first year of life. (loc 1132)</p>

<p>In contrast, when parents engaged in face-to-face conversation with the child—speaking in fully adult, sophisticated language as if the child could be part of a chatty, grown-up conversation—the impact on cognitive development was enormous. These richer interactions they called “language dancing.” Language dancing is being chatty, thinking aloud, and commenting on what the child is doing and what the parent is doing or planning to do. “Do you want to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt today?” “Do you think it will rain today?” “Do you remember the time I put your bottle in the oven by mistake?” (loc 1142)</p>

<p>The theory of capabilities gives companies the framework to determine when outsourcing makes sense, and when it does not. There are two important considerations. First, you must take a dynamic view of your suppliers’ capabilities. Assume that they can and will change. You should not focus on what the suppliers are doing now, but, rather, focus on what they are striving to be able to do in the future. Second, and most critical of all: figure out what capabilities you will need to succeed in the future. These must stay in-house—otherwise, you are handing over the future of your business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good if you like integrals and will need to be calibrating vol models]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Volatility Surface: a Practitioner’s Guide</em> does not come across as a practitioner’s guide. There are gems of practical wisdom, but these are hidden deep within pages of arcane mathematics which, in my opinion, should be in the appendix if they are to be included at all.</p>
<p>This criticism is not primarily centred on the difficulty of the mathematics: volatility is a difficult subject so I wouldn’t expect any proper treatment to be straightforward. Rather, the book is too mathematical in the sense that even when I bit the bullet and worked through some of the derivations in full (dusting off some of the Mathematical Methods lecture notes from university), they seldom gave much insight. Rather than being a “practitioner’s guide”, the book comes across as a follow-along exercise book for students taking his lecture course at NYU to pick up some mathematical tricks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the organisation of the book is bizarre. Jargon is introduced without explanation; subjects are discussed without being put into context; figures and tables are inserted with little reference or commentary. One gets the impression that this book was a rather hasty compilation of lecture notes into textbook format.</p>
<p>All this said, there were parts of the book that I liked: the treatment of jumps and default risk were pitched at the right level of detail, with a clear emphasis on practicality. Gatheral also does make valuable points regarding the qualitative differences between stochastic volatility fits and local volatility fits, though you have to dig through the book to find these.</p>
<p>Perhaps my criticisms are unfair. I presume the target audience for this book is a sell-side derivatives quant, which I certainly am not. Nevertheless, I got a lot more out of Maxime de Bellefroid’s <a href="/?books=the-derivatives-academy" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Derivatives Academy</a>, which contains many of the same insights in a <em>much</em> more accessible format, though it sometimes lacks detail (and in many cases references Gatheral!).</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Black-Scholes as your hammer, everything looks like an option]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>They say (disparagingly) that once you learn about options you start to see them everywhere. In some sense, the study of real options takes this literally. The idea is that there are many situations in business management where one must decide what to pay for optionality and, in the case where optionality is already owned, when to exercise the option.</p>
<p>Here are some questions that can be answered with real options:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How much to pay to acquire a mine</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How much you should invest into R&amp;D that might give you access to a new market (currently small but may be large in the future)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">How much to pay to acquire a patent</li>
</ul>
<p>While I’m fascinated by the subject, I didn’t think the book was particularly good. This isn’t entirely the fault of the authors: they have the tough job of conveying tricky options concepts to MBA students and managers who may not have the mathematical background. That said, the structure was confusing with lots of repetition.</p>
<p>On a more technical point, I don’t think the authors have spent enough time discussing the theoretical basis for the use of real options – in particular, the validity of Black-Scholes given the inability to trade in the underlying.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cheerfully challenge your philosophical idols with light taps of a hammer]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even for somebody who knows nothing about Nietzche, based on the frequency with which Nietzche is referenced in pop culture one has to assume that he is generally misinterpreted – it is a high bar for an idea to reach the popular consciousness, higher still for that idea to be the same as what the author intended.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I decided to read Nietzche not out of some deep desire to understand his controversial ideas, but simply because I saw the book in a charity shop in Oxford and was surprised by how slim it was. My impression had previously been that philosophy dealt in massive tomes of impenetrable prose (Kant’s <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> would make for a decent blunt-trauma murder weapon), but Nietzche specifically rails against this:</p>
<p>Now the lack of jargon does not make Nietzsche an easy read – his sentences are complex and many thoughts are left uncompleted. It is a conversation with the reader, an attempt to guide the reader to shed their philosophical “idols”.</p>
<p>Yet <em>Twilight of the Idols</em> , one of Nietzche’s later works, is surprisingly enjoyable. Nietzche begins with his <em>Maxims and Barbs</em> , a set of highly quotable aphorisms (including the inspiration for Kelly Clarkson’s “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”). He then discusses several mostly distinct ideas (<em>Twilight</em> is essentially a collection of essays) but with certain common threads: the importance of adversity, criticisms of “idols” like Christianity, the meaning of freedom. I particularly enjoyed <em>The Four Great Errors</em> , which is full of generally applicable wisdom (though slightly skewing to criticisms of Judeo-Christian morality), and <em>Reconnaissance Raids</em> – Nietzche’s opinions on religion, psychology, as well as both historical and contemporary philosophers, artists, and writers.</p>
<p>Nietzche can be downright playful. His writing is full of many puns (few of which, unfortunately, survive the translation into English), and he prefaces the book by saying:</p>
<p>At the same time, he is often blatantly sexist, discriminatory of people with ill health, and does little to hide his massive ego:</p>
<p>Ultimately, I have no business reviewing <em>Twilight</em> nor, for that matter, any other classic piece of philosophy. I am an inexperienced reader of philosophy, so it is difficult for me to understand what exactly Nietzche is saying, let alone put the ideas into their context. Instead, I am treating these texts primarily as stimuli to encourage me to think more deeply. The lessons I extract from the book may be completely different to what the author intended but that doesn’t matter so much to me. So let this review serve as nothing more than a note to highlight aspects of Nietzsche that made me think, and a memento to flag ideas that I would like to contextualise and revisit in future once I’ve got more philosophical reading under my belt.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">On education:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">we need cheerfulness: “you cannot subtract every form of dancing from noble education, the ability to dance with the feet, with concepts, with words”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“What is needed is educators who have educated themselves: superior, noble minds, proven at every moment, proven by their words and silences”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">On freedom:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">“the expression of maturity and mastery in the midst of doing, creating, affecting, willing; breathing easily, ‘freedom of the will’ “</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">to achieve freedom one needs to become “more indifferent towards hardship, harshness, privation, even life itself. [...] prepared to sacrifice people to one’s cause—oneself included”</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Freedom is measured in what it costs to be free: “the resistance which must be overcome, the effort it costs to stay on top. The highest type of free men would need to be sought in the place where the greatest resistance is constantly being overcome: a short step away from tyranny, right on the threshold of the danger of servitude”. Hence Nietzche’s respect for Caesar, Napoleon.</li>

<p>In Twilight, Nietzsche brings to a culmination the project which he had announced a decade earlier in the programmatic first paragraph of <em>Human, All Too Human</em> , that of unmasking the mundane origins of seemingly transcendent goods, subjecting them to a ‘genealogical’ reduction in order to reveal that ‘the most glorious colours are derived from base, indeed from despised materials’ (HA I 1), reducing the grand explanatory gestures of idealist metaphysics to the level of ‘little unpretentious truths’ (loc 206)</p>

<p>Nietzsche often taking a proverb, homily, or otherwise ‘time-honoured truth’—such as ‘The Devil finds work for idle hands to do’ in the very first paragraph (I 1), ‘All truth is simple’ (I 4), or ‘He who laughs last, laughs longest’ (I 43)—and displacing it slightly, giving it a new twist, or completely inverting it, so as to debunk it and make us question its validity. Such saws are precisely the kind of fraudulent ‘eternal idols’ Nietzsche is out to unseat: at the beginning of the next section (II 1) he will explicitly take issue with the ‘consensus of the wise’; here he is already squaring up to ‘the wisest of all ages’ more implicitly, by disputing the claim of even the cosiest, most consensual ‘truths’ to universalizability. (loc 323)</p>

<p>In ‘The Four Great Errors’ Nietzsche will repeatedly warn against confusing cause and consequence (VI I); here, in keeping with his own injunction, he discreetly revises his earlier judgement of the philosopher—though this does not prevent him citing The Birth of Tragedy (II 2) as though his reflections here were merely a continuation in the same vein. We need to beware of such surreptitious retrospective modifications, which are typical of Nietzsche’s late writings (loc 371)</p>

<p>he explicitly criticizes Schopenhauer for perpetrating ‘the greatest piece of psychological counterfeiting in history, Christianity excepted’ (IX 21), by interpreting art in general as a denial of the will, and of the procreative urge above all (IX 22), when for him art is the exact opposite, ‘the great stimulant to life’ (IX 24).

<p>Nietzsche’s own idea of progress is a very different one: he envisages history not as the ascent of man toward the glittering heights of some gimcrack new Jerusalem, but rather as a succession of long periods of mediocrity punctuated by forceful explosions which give birth to such exemplary individuals as Caesar and Napoleon (IX 38, 44-5, 48).

<p>In the finale of his Sixth (‘Tragic’) Symphony Gustav Mahler, one of the most Nietzschean of composers, introduces an actual hammer into his orchestration, to depict ‘the hero on whom three blows of fate descend, the last of which fells him like a tree’. But just as Mahler was diagnosed with a fatal heart condition only a year after the symphony’s first performance, so Nietzsche was felled by his own hammer-blow of fate barely six weeks after receiving the first prepublication copies of Twilight. The book was eventually published on 24 January 1889, but on 3 January its author had collapsed into the perpetual twilight of insanity. (loc 566)</p>

<p>the ‘overman’ (übermensch) is one of Nietzsche’s key figures who makes his only appearance in Twilight here. He is defined in Ecce Homo as ‘a type that has turned out supremely well, in antithesis to “modern” men, to “good” men, to Christians and other nihilists’ (EH III 1): producing the overman is the goal of the self-overcoming of humanity; he is ‘beyond good and evil’, the embodiment of Nietzsche’s ‘philosophy of the future’.

<p>Judgements, value judgements on life, whether for or against, can ultimately never be true: they have value only as symptoms, they can be considered only as symptoms—in themselves such judgements are foolish. We must really stretch out our fingers and make the effort to grasp this astonishing finesse, that the value of life cannot be assessed.* Not by a living person because he is an interested party, indeed even the object of dispute, and not the judge; nor by a dead person, for a different reason. (loc 785)</p>

<p>I am seeking to understand what was the idiosyncrasy which gave rise to that Socratic equation, reason = virtue = happiness: that most bizarre of all equations which, in particular, has all the instincts of the older Hellene ranged against it. (loc 803)</p>

<p>The dialectician leaves it to his opponent to prove he is not an idiot: he infuriates him and makes him helpless at the same time. The dialectician disempowers his opponent’s intellect.—What? is dialectics just a form of revenge for Socrates? (loc 820)</p>

<p>I have indicated how Socrates could be repulsive: the fact that he did fascinate people needs all the more explaining.—For one thing he discovered a new kind of agon [competition] and was its first fencing master for the noble circles of Athens. He fascinated people by stirring up the agonal drive of the Hellenes—he introduced a variation into the wrestling match between young men and youths. (loc 822)</p>

<p>The moralism of Greek philosophers from Plato onwards is pathologically conditioned: likewise their appreciation of dialectics. Reason = virtue = happiness means simply: we must imitate Socrates and establish permanent daylight to combat the dark desires—the daylight of reason. We must be clever, clear, bright at all costs: any yielding to the instincts, to the unconscious, leads downwards (loc 841)</p>

<p>Man’s three ‘inner facts’, the things he believed in most firmly—the will, the mind, the I—were projected out of himself: he derived the concept of Being from the concept of the I, and posited the existence of ‘things’ after his own image, after his concept of the I as cause. No wonder if, later on, he only ever rediscovered in things what he had put in them.—The thing itself, to say it again, the concept of thing: just a reflection of the belief in the I as cause...

<p>Schopenhauer — the last German to be worth considering (—to be a European event like Goethe, Hegel, Heinrich Heine, and not just a local, ‘national’ one), is to the psychologist a case of the first order: namely as a brilliantly malicious attempt to bring to bear in the service of a nihilistic devaluation of all life* precisely the counter-examples, the great self-affirmations of the ‘will to life’, the exuberance-forms of life. He interpreted in turn art, heroism, genius, beauty, great fellow-feeling, knowledge, the will to truth, tragedy as consequences of the ‘denial’ of the ‘will’, or the need to deny it—the greatest piece of psychological counterfeiting in history, Christianity excepted.

<p>Morality for Physicians.—A sick person is a parasite on society. Once one has reached a certain state it is indecent to live any longer. Vegetating on in cowardly dependence on physicians and their methods, once the meaning of life, the right to life has been lost, should be greeted with society’s profound contempt. (loc 1629)</p>
<p>the highest interest of life, of ascending life, demands that degenerating life be ruthlessly pushed down and aside—for example in the case of the right to procreate, the right to be born, the right to live... Die proudly if it is no longer possible to live proudly. (loc 1633)</p>

<p>My Idea of Freedom.—The value of a thing sometimes depends not on what we manage to do with it, but on what we pay for it—what it costs (loc 1696)</p>

<p>Liberal institutions stop being liberal as soon as they have been set up: afterwards there is no one more inveterate or thorough in damaging freedom than liberal institutions. (loc 1697)</p>
<p><em>Capitalist institutions stop being capitalist as soon as they have been set up, c.f</em> <em><a href="/?books=the-myth-of-capitalism" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Myth of Capitalism</a></em> <em>.</em></p>

<p>For what is freedom! Having the will to be responsible to oneself. Maintaining the distance which divides us off from each other. Becoming more indifferent towards hardship, harshness, privation, even life itself. Being prepared to sacrifice people to one’s cause—oneself included. Freedom means that the manly instincts which delight in war and victory rule over other instincts, for example the instincts for ‘happiness’. The liberated man—and the liberated spirit even more so—tramples over the contemptible kind of well-being that shopkeepers, Christians, cows, women, Englishmen, and other democrats dream about. The free man is a warrior.—How is freedom measured, in individuals as well as nations? By the resistance which must be overcome, the effort it costs to stay on top. The highest type of free men would need to be sought in the place where the greatest resistance is constantly being overcome: a short step away from tyranny, right on the threshold of the danger of servitude. (loc 1703)</p>

<p>The nations which were worth something, became worth something, never did so under liberal institutions: it was great danger that turned them into something worthy of respect, the kind of danger without which we would not know our instruments, our virtues, our defences and weapons, our spirit—which forces us to be strong... First principle: you must need to be strong, or else you will never become (loc 1712)</p>

<p>The rationality of marriage lay in the principle of its indissolubility: this gave it an accent which, set against the contingencies of feeling, passion, and the moment, could make itself heard. Likewise it lay in the responsibility of families for the choice of husband and wife. The increasing indulgence shown towards love-matches has practically eliminated the basis for marriage, the thing which makes it an institution in the first place. (loc 1734)</p>

<p>My Idea of Genius.—Great men, like periods of greatness, are explosives storing up immense energy; historically and physiologically speaking, their precondition is always that they be collected, accumulated, saved, and preserved for over a long period—that there be a long period without explosions.* Once the tension in the mass becomes too great, then the most accidental stimulus is enough to bring ‘genius’, ‘action’, a great destiny into the world. (loc 1776)</p>
<p>The great person is an end; the period of greatness, for example the Renaissance, is an end. The genius—in his works, in his deeds—is necessarily a squanderer: his greatness lies in his expenditure... The instinct for self-preservation is, so to speak, unhinged; the overwhelming pressure of the energies streaming out from him forbids him any such care and caution. (loc 1791)</p>
<p>He streams out, he overflows, he consumes himself, he does not spare himself—fatefully, fatally, involuntarily, just as a river bursts its banks involuntarily. But because we owe a great deal to such explosives, we have given them a great deal in return, too, for example a kind of higher morality... For that is how humanity expresses its gratitude: it misunderstands its benefactors.— (loc 1795)</p>

<p>Almost every genius is familiar with ‘Catilinarian existence’* as one stage in his development, a feeling of hatred, revenge, and rebellion against all that already is and no longer becomes*... Catiline—the form in which every Caesar pre-exists.— (loc 1822)</p>
<p><em>Catiline led two unsuccesful coup attempts in 65,63 BC. Predates Caesar’s coup in 49BC.</em></p>

<p>it is possible for a man of knowledge to lie out of politeness. It has been said, not without subtlety: ‘il est indigne des grands cœurs de répandre le trouble, qu’ils ressentent’:* except one must add that being unafraid of what is most unworthy may equally be greatness of soul. (loc 1826)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[the rest is just details]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</em> (<em>SFAH</em> ) is a gentle book about the principles behind cooking. It is not primarily a recipe book, nor is it a book about cooking techniques. Instead, <em>SFAH</em> aims to help build chef’s intuition: the remarkable ability some cooks have to look through a fridge or pantry and design a tasty meal on the spot – one whose elements balance, with just the right amount of contrast; the skill to taste a sauce and figure out and identify what’s missing, be that a splash of vinegar or a pinch of sugar.</p>
<p><em>SFAH</em> is a nice blend of story, science, and practical wisdom that makes for an entertaining and informative read. The main issue for me personally (which probably says more about me than the book) is that efficiency is not at all a variable in the author’s calculus – for most home cooks, the time it takes to cook a dish and the number of steps to prepare it are reasonably important factors (as is the hassle of washing up!).</p>
<p>So while there are many tips that I will adopt in future (e.g dry brining meat in advance; preheating a pan before preheating oil), and certainly many aspects of the book that I will revisit (like the flavour maps), many of the recipes are too involved for my liking. Thankfully, there are YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CookwithE">Ethan Chlebowski</a> who (in my view) have similar priorities to me: some mix of taste, convenience, and health.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perpetually amusing and delightfully clever.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my third re-reading of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> : I first read it (or someone read it to me) when I was little and I read it again when I was in high school. I decided that it would be a fitting book for a day trip to Oxford, where Charles Dodgson pseudonymously wrote it, and it hasn’t lost an ounce of charm.</p>
<p>Despite being a children’s book, <em>Alice</em> perpetually amuses. Packed with delightfully clever wordplay, false syllogisms, and dry humour, every re-read brings new gems that I missed the first time – and still, things that I don’t quite understand! A few years ago these points of misunderstanding would have really frustrated me, but I’m now sanguine enough for them to leave me pleasantly excited for the next re-read.</p>
<p><em>Alice in Wonderland</em> provided an early exposure to the intrinsic value of thought. It encouraged me to point my mind inwards – to reflect on how my internal program parses logical statements. In retrospect, it probably contributed to my fascination with cognitive errors and epistemology. It’s also an intellectual precursor to some other books that were impactful in my formative years: <a href="/?books=g%C3%B6del-escher-bach-an-eternal-golden-braid" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</a>, and <em>Catch-22.</em></p>
<p>A great book for people of all ages, and one that only gets better on each subsequent re-read.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes “Do bats eat cats?”, for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. (loc 56)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. (loc 71)</p>
<p><em>Poor cheshire cat!</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. (loc 89)</p>
<p><em>Lovely little forays into philosophical ideas like essentialism.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. “I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone: “so I ca’n’t take more.” “You mean you ca’n’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to take more than nothing.” (loc 729)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life. The King’s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense. The Queen’s argument was that, if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time, she’d have everybody executed, all round. (loc 878)</p>
<p><em>Perfectly captures the spirit of the book!</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise——” “Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked. “We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily. “Really you are very dull!” (loc 968)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, “are done with whiting. Now you know.” “And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. “Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.” (loc 1064)</p>

        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=what-it-takes</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=what-it-takes"/>
        <updated>2022-02-23T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Think big, solve problems for people, and build networks]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really wanted to hate this book – my pre-judgement was that it would be a thinly-veiled list of achievements and self-aggrandisement. This is true in part. But Schwarzman is undeniably an industry titan and there is a lot to learn from his story; he was incredibly scrappy and had a good sense for balancing confidence and bold actions with humility and subtle acts of service. The book is full of amusing anecdotes, for example when Schwarzman told his interviewer at DLJ that he wouldn’t accept the investment banking offer (widely coveted by many students) unless his salary made him the highest-paid Yale grad.</p>
<p>Schwarzman is a talented business builder and <em>What it Takes</em> contains many valuable insights won in the heat of battle – similar in tone to Bob Iger’s <a href="/?books=the-ride-of-a-lifetime" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Ride of a Lifetime</a>, but with a greater emphasis on practicality takeaways both for operators and for students. The Blackstone story is told elsewhere (e.g <em>King of Capital</em> ), but hearing the perspective of the man calling the shots lends a certain depth to the historical events, and gives greater colour on the firm’s unique culture.</p>
<p>The second half of the book becomes quite tedious: the density of insights drops precipitously, heavily diluted by self-congratulation about Schwarzman’s philanthropic endeavours and political clout. Some of this is vaguely interesting, but also somewhat worrying – should a private citizen really have so much influence over government? In any case, there are few actionable takeaways here.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the book ends on a high note: Schwarzman summarises his experiences into “25 Rules for Work and Life” (which can also be found <a href="https://readwhatittakes.com/25-rules/">online</a>), distilling and reiterating the most important ideas that he touched on throughout the book. This is definitely worth reading and for the time-pressed individual, it might be a reasonable substitute for reading the whole book.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Pick up the phone! Follow up with people; ask for advice from people you respect; be there to help others solve their problems.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Go big or go home. Achieving things is hard, so you may as well go for big things that are worth your effort.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Listen closely and solve problems for other people, especially during negotiations.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Think long term: it is often worth sacrificing short-term EV for goodwill, which pays off in the long term.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Human capital is high leverage: hire 10s because they go on to hire other 10s.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Seize the moment: major returns come from bold moments of decisiveness. Time hurts all deals.</li>

<p>I believe that education is a discipline. The object of this discipline is to learn how to think. Once we have mastered this we can use it to learn a vocation, appreciate art, or read a book. Education simply enables us to appreciate the ever-changing drama fashioned of God’s own hand, life itself. (loc 229)</p>

<p>people who succeed in finance must start with repetitive practice before they can ever hope to achieve mastery. (loc 800)</p>
<p><em>I am of split minds on this: there is certainly value in repetitive practice, but it’s never been clear to me that it’s the</em> **<em>optimal</em> ** <em>way to learn. In the classic apprentice model, the “tradeoff” is that you get to learn from practitioners in exchange for doing their grunt work. In a perfect world, perhaps you could learn from the practitioners without doing their grunt work?</em></p>

<p>There are people who come to finance from other professions, from law or the media perhaps, but the best I’ve ever worked with grew up in it. They learned by doing the fundamental analysis. They established strong foundations for their careers by discovering that the smallest things matter and suffering the indignity of their early mistakes. (loc 802)</p>

<p>I observed that when I was the one making the decisions and the voices rose and tempers flared, my heart would beat faster and my breathing would become more shallow. I became less effective, less in control of my own cognitive responses. The fix, I found, was to focus on my breathing, slow it down and relax my shoulders, until my breaths were long and deep. The effect was astonishing. My thoughts became clearer. I became more objective and rational about the situation at hand, about what I needed to do to win. (loc 867)</p>
<p><em>Something I’ve become more interested in recently: there is growing scientific research that classical yogi breathing techniques can improve health outcomes (see</em> <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo">this</a></em> <em>Huberman interview) and obviously there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to the same effect.</em></p>

<p>One effect of my intense listening is that I can recall events and conversations in detail. It’s as if they are imprinted and stored away in my brain. A lot of people fail because they start from a position of self-interest. What’s in this for me? They will never get to do the most interesting and rewarding work. Listening closely and watching the way people talk puts me much closer to answering the question I’m always asking myself, which is: How can I help? If I can help someone and become a friend to their situation, everything else follows. (loc 969)</p>

<p>it’s as hard to start and run a small business as it is to start a big one. You will suffer the same toll financially and psychologically as you bludgeon it into existence. It’s hard to raise the money and to find the right people. So if you’re going to dedicate your life to a business, which is the only way it will ever work, you should choose one with the potential to be huge. (loc 1143)</p>

<p>To be successful you have to put yourself in situations and places you have no right being in. You shake your head and learn from your own stupidity. But through sheer will, you wear the world down, and it gives you what you want. (loc 1676)</p>
<p><em>&quot;Somebody may beat me [...] but by God they’re going to have to bleed to do it.&quot; – Phil Knight in</em> <em><a href="/?books=shoe-dog" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Shoe Dog</a></em> **</p>

<p>Harvard Business School was teaching only one idea, disguised as different courses. The lesson was that everything in business relates to everything else. For a business to succeed, each part has to work on its own and with all the other parts. (loc 551)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you are going to start a business, I told them, I believe it has to pass three basic tests. First, your idea has to be big enough to justify devoting your life to it. Make sure it has the potential to be huge. Second, it should be unique. When people see what you are offering, they should say to themselves, “My gosh, I need this. I’ve been waiting for this. This really appeals to me.” Without that “aha!” you are wasting your time. Third, your timing must be right. The world actually doesn’t like pioneers, so if you are too early, your risk of failure is high. The market you are targeting should be lifting off with enough momentum to help make you successful.

<p>We carved the transportation division out of USX and called it Transtar. (loc 1621)</p>
<p>It proved to be a phenomenal deal. The market for steel did recover, as we predicted. The transport business came back, and the investments we made in Transtar improved its cash flow. Within two years, we had made nearly four times our equity. By 2003, when we sold our final stake in the business, we had made a total return of twenty-six times our investment, or 130 percent a year. For the next fifteen years, we financed almost every deal with Chemical Bank. Our businesses grew together. The erstwhile Comical went on to swallow Manufacturers Hanover, Bank One, Chase Manhattan, and eventually JPMorgan itself, whose name they adopted. (loc 1622)</p>

<p>These investors revel in the transaction itself, in playing with the deal terms, in beating up their opponent at the negotiating table. That has always seemed short term to me. What that thinking ignores is all the value you can realize once you own an asset: the improvements you can make, the refinancing you can do to improve your returns, the timing of your sale to make the most of a rising market. If you waste all your energy and goodwill in pursuit of the lowest possible purchase price and end up losing the asset to a higher bidder, all that future value goes away. Sometimes it’s best to pay what you have to pay and focus on what you can then do as an owner. The returns to successful ownership will often be much higher than the returns on winning a one-off battle over price. (loc 1735)</p>

<p>Most public and private investors buy too early and underestimate the severity of recessions. It’s important not to react too quickly. Most investors don’t have the confidence or discipline to wait until a cycle fully plays out. These investors suffer by not maximizing the profit they would have otherwise made from executing the same idea at a later point. (loc 1813)</p>

<p>“But there are times when you just have to stand up and write a check. You have to show customers that you own this, because if you don’t, they’re not going to trust you ever again.” I had felt the pain of this dilemma after our experience with Edgcomb, I had made sure we paid back the banks that lent to us. It would have cost us a lot more to earn back their trust on later deals if we had not made them whole right then. (loc 2916)</p>

<p>In the late 1930s, the US government, scarred by the Great Depression, prohibited mark-to-market accounting. They saw that in any normal year, almost any asset class, including stocks and bonds, will go up or down by 10 to 15 percent. In a boom or crisis year, it could be even more. It would be terrible for the health of the economy if companies acted like Chicken Little, constantly rebalancing their assets or liabilities based on that day’s movements in the markets instead of coolly managing for the long term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spice must flow]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The World for Sale</em> is a fascinating deconstruction of the global commodity trading industry. There are many excellent books about different areas of finance – <em>King of Capital</em> for PE**, <em><a href="/?books=more-money-than-god" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">More Money Than God</a></em> ** for hedge funds**, Michael Lewis for sell-side trading. Yet there are conspicuously few stories about physical commodities. Even the accounts in <a href="/?books=the-new-market-wizards" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The New Market Wizards</a> focus only on trading “paper” (futures contracts) rather than the actual physical commodity.</p>
<p>This is not for lack of interesting material: many of the tales in <em>The World for Sale</em> involve buccaneering and scrappy traders flying off to distant lands to strike handshake deals with all kinds of people (for example, Marc Rich &amp; Co dealing with the apartheid government of South Africa), or Ian Taylor’s private jet swerving to dodge missiles as he lands in Benghazi to deal. Nor is it for lack of scale: the trading houses make billions of PnL a year, split among a relatively small pool of partners, with individual traders like Andy Hall individually making nine figures on occasion. Instead, it seems that the industry is secret simply because the market participants prefer it that way: many physical trades are bilateral deals that don’t need to be disclosed to a central source.</p>
<p>It is a testament to the skilled journalism of Blas and Farchy that despite the opacity of the industry they have been able to piece together a coherent narrative, covering not only the classic trades of the last half-century (Andy Hall’s Gulf War trades; the Reuben brothers conquest of the post-Soviet aluminium market; Vitol’s shenanigans with Kurdish oil) but also the larger-than-life characters who made the wagers (Marc Rich, Johann Deuss, Andy Hall, Ian Taylor, Ivan Glasenberg) and the trading shops that housed them.</p>
<p><em>The World for Sale</em> is readable as it is insightful: the authors summarise their analysis into four key themes which explain the rise of the commodity traders, then draw on their extensive experience covering commodities to suggest what the future may hold for the industry. In their view, the glory days of physical commods trading are in the past, but if history is anything to go by, we shouldn’t be surprised when the traders find new ways to make themselves indispensable.</p>

<p>‘Always have something to sell,’ explained Ernst Frank, the company’s specialist in copper, lead and zinc. ‘Always be in the business, then sometimes a real shortage develops and if one has material to sell one can make real money.’ (loc 568)</p>

<p>the first commodity trading companies that bear any resemblance to today’s traders did not appear until the nineteenth century. (loc 419)</p>

<p>Oil trading had briefly flourished in the nineteenth century after the first discovery of oil in America at Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859. But the trade abruptly dried up when John Rockefeller bought up control of nearly all the refining capacity in America for his Standard Oil Trust. With only one buyer in town, there was no competition, and so no market. The price of oil was decided by Rockefeller. (loc 523)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For a brief period, oil futures were traded on at least twenty exchanges across the US. But the primitive market for oil derivatives – like the spot trade in physical oil – came to an end when Rockefeller won control of the industry. (loc 1656)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>On 30 March 1983, Nymex reinvented the market with the launch of its futures contract for light, sweet oil – that is, low density oil with low levels of sulphur – based on West Texas Intermediate crude delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma, where Atlantic Richfield (today part of BP) had a major storage hub. (loc 1658)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Until the 1950s, the Soviet Union’s oil had come largely from Baku on the Caspian Sea, whose riches had been exploited since the nineteenth century. But now geologists began to develop new deposits in the Volga-Urals basin, and Soviet oil output doubled between 1955 and 1960. The Soviet Union displaced Venezuela as the second-largest oil producer in the world, behind only the US. (loc 547)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The erosion of the power of the Western corporate oligopoly had reached a key juncture in August 1960. With Soviet oil undermining their market dominance, executives at Standard Oil of New Jersey (a forerunner of ExxonMobil) had taken it upon themselves to cut their Middle East posted price by 7% – without consulting the governments of the countries that were producing it. The sheikhs were livid. Resentful about the loss of income and furious that they hadn’t been consulted on the price cut, oil-producing nations started agitating for action. A month later, the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait gathered in Baghdad. After four days of deliberations, they announced, on 14 September 1960, the birth of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – or OPEC. (loc 701)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>OPEC would turn the oil market and the world economy on its head, ending the dominance of the Seven Sisters for good and handing huge power to the commodity traders. As oil-producing countries nationalised their petroleum industries, the traders became essential conduits to move their crude to the international market. (loc 710)</p>

<p>Belousov – spurred on by the risk of mass starvation at home after the Soviet crops had failed – bought almost 20 million tonnes of grains and oilseeds from the grain traders. The size of the wheat purchases was extraordinary: 11.8 million tonnes – equal to almost 30% of the US wheat harvest. When the market woke up to the sale, it was clear the US wouldn’t have enough grain to meet the combination of its own domestic consumption, the demand from traditional importers, and the extra purchases from the Soviet Union. (loc 643)</p>
<p>The episode became known as the ‘Great Grain Robbery’. (loc 650)</p>

<p>throughout history, when commodity prices surged, politicians had found an easy scapegoat in the form of speculators. In AD 301 the Roman Emperor Diocletian imposed a cap on the prices of hundreds of goods in response to ‘greed’ which ‘raves and burns and sets no limit on itself’. In 1897, Germany’s Reichstag banned trading in wheat futures after a disastrous harvest sent prices soaring. And in the 1950s, US politicians outlawed the trading of onion futures – a ban that has remained in place to this day. (loc 3978)</p>

<p>Jamaica was a prime example: the country was on the brink of bankruptcy, shunned by its lenders, and Rich had just delivered the government oil worth $10 million without even signing a contract. The risk would be worth it, though. The Jamaican government would not forget how Rich had saved it from ruin. The Caribbean island would become a source of profits for Rich and his successors for decades to come. (loc 1173)</p>

<p>Marc Rich’s deals with Jamaica were emblematic of the shifts taking place in the world economy in the 1970s and 1980s. From Jamaica to Saudi Arabia and Guyana to Peru, the decades of global economic growth had spurred massive investments in commodity production around the world. Now, governments across the Middle East, Africa and Latin America had been seizing control of the commodities they produced in a wave of nationalisations. The shift in power from large American and European oil and mining companies to governments in what was known as the Third World opened a window of opportunity for the commodity traders that they exploited with gusto. In the process they became the connection between many newly assertive countries and the global financial system, helping to channel dollars to governments and leaders that had no other source of funding.

<p>Marc Rich + Co started offering the struggling smelters a deal: the trading house would supply them with alumina, and as payment take the aluminium they produced. This type of deal, exchanging a raw material for a finished product, was called ‘tolling’ and had been used before in oil and zinc, but Marc Rich + Co brought it to the aluminium sector.

And so Cobuco was born. Officially, the company was a joint venture half owned by Rich and half by the government of Burundi. On paper, it was perfectly above-board: its constitution was even formally approved by the African nation’s parliament. In reality, the trader’s scheme amounted to an absurdist joke. (loc 1480)</p>

<p>If Iraq was the country in direst need of higher prices, Kuwait was the most notorious cheater among the members of OPEC. At the beginning of the year, the emirate had quietly started to offer discounts to some refineries if they would buy extra barrels. Kuwait, ignoring its OPEC commitments, was hoping to make up for the drop in oil revenues by increasing production. Phibro Energy, which owned four refineries, soon got word of what Kuwait was doing: it only reinforced Hall’s conviction that oil prices were headed lower. (loc 1697)</p>

It looked very much like the one Dauphin had been negotiating, with a few small tweaks: within months, Marc Rich would sell enough shares so that he no longer had a controlling stake in the company; Strothotte would return as chief executive, but Rich would remain as chairman; and the company would keep the name Marc Rich + Co.

<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union was a seismic event for the commodity traders, the most significant development in the history of the industry since the oil market had been freed from the grip of the Seven Sisters in the 1970s. At the time of its break-up, the Soviet Union pumped more oil than any other country in the world and was also one of the biggest producers of metals and grain. Now, at a stroke, it was transformed from a closed system into a shambolically integrated part of the world economy. Until the early 1990s, the Soviet Union’s trade with the outside world had been tightly controlled by the State. Suddenly Russian aluminium, copper, zinc, oil and coal flooded on to global markets. For a while, Russia and the other former Soviet states had little infrastructure to export their commodities, no expertise on how to sell internationally, and no connection to the world of finance.

<p>Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who came to power after the death of Mao Zedong, set out a new direction for the country. Deng rejected the chaos and terror of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, and called for a new economic era under the rubric of reform and opening: a limited embrace of capitalism and growing engagement with the outside world. ‘Under our present system of economic management, power is over-concentrated, so it is necessary to devolve some of it to the lower levels,’ he said. ‘Otherwise, we won’t be able to rid our country of poverty and backwardness or to catch up with – still less surpass – the advanced countries.’ (loc 2799)</p>

<p>Even if a very poor country grows rapidly, it doesn’t translate into much extra demand for commodities. The same is true for a very rich country.</p>
<p>In between the two extremes, there’s a sweet spot for commodities demand. After per capita income rises above $4,000, countries typically industrialise and urbanise, creating a strong, and sometimes disproportionate, relationship between further economic growth and extra commodity demand. China hit the commodity sweet spot around the time that Davis wrote his Xstrata memo (loc 2822)</p>

<p>A normal commodity price cycle, the result of a supply shock, such as a crop failure or a mine closure, tends to be short-lived: the rise in prices stimulates additional supply and cools demand, and the market rebalances. Supercycles are demand led, and last longer. They tend to coincide with periods of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in the global economy. The first modern commodity supercycle, for example, was triggered by the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century in Europe and America; the second, by the global rearmament before the Second World War; the third, by the economic boom of the Pax Americana and the reconstruction of Europe and Japan in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The fourth began around the turn of the millennium, as China and other emerging economies entered the commodity sweet spot. (loc 2848)</p>

And then I started checking all the supply data and I started digging into what the oil companies were doing in terms of adding to reserves, and it just didn’t add up.’ Like Mick Davis, Andy Hall believed the market was out of whack when it came to the futures market. By the middle of 2003, spot oil prices had tripled from their low point in 1998 to trade at close to $30 a barrel. But futures for delivery several years later were still trading below $25.

<p>For Trafigura, one of the pioneers of the Kurdish oil trade, the magic trick involved the Eilat–Ashkelon pipeline, the very same route that Marc Rich had employed in the 1970s to bring Iranian oil via Israel into Europe. The pipeline was, by now, able to pump oil in both directions. And so Trafigura sent its tankers to Ashkelon to discharge the Kurdish crude, which then travelled across Israel to the Red Sea port of Eilat, where the trail became impossible to follow. Some of the oil ended up in Israel itself; some made its way to the independent oil refineries in China that are known, because of their often rudimentary design, as teapots. (loc 4502)</p>

The Iranians used a shell company in Liechtenstein to hide their ownership of half of the company, while the Israelis used a Panamanian entity. Even today, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz describes the company as ‘the most secretive firm in Israel’. (loc 730)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are layers and layers of circuits]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Prometheus Rising</em> is a quirky but illuminating book, tying together diverse threads from psychoanalysis, mysticism, religious history, neuroscience, sociology, and (questionable) quantum physics. It is an exploration of consciousness and subjective reality – the power of the human brain.</p>
<p>The book starts by presenting a simple model for the brain: a computer that can run several different types of programs. Genetics determine the “operating system”, but at certain stages of our development, we are vulnerable to <em>imprints</em> – programs that modify the circuits in our brain and thus constrain the other programs (conditioning, learning) that we can run in later life. For example, the first experience a newborn has with their mother is a strong determinant of their future anxiety/self-confidence; an adolescent’s experiences during puberty shape their sexual preferences as an adult.</p>
<p>Wilson (henceforth RAW) explores these ideas through the lens of Timothy O’Leary’s Eight-circuit model of consciousness. The first four circuits are closely analogous to the psychoanalytical work of Freud and Jung: the bio-survival circuit that codes for “advance vs retreat”, the emotional-territorial circuit that codes for socially dominant/submissive behaviour, the time-binding semantic circuit represents the rational mind, and the socio-sexual circuit encodes our morality.</p>
<p>This part of the book is deeply insightful: personally, it represents a big leap forward in the vocabulary I can use to understand why I’m the way I am, and why other people are the way they are – perhaps I have previously been too hasty to write off psychoanalysis as garbage. RAW also tugs on some interesting speculative threads about the role of these circuits in society, for example, how politicians tap into circuits I and II (e.g. Trump creating an “us vs them” emotional-territorial circuit II trigger) to subvert the rational circuit III. He playfully explores the links between these psychoanalytical ideas and various aspects of mysticism and religion; in particular, there is some lucid commentary of <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em> , which had previously been beyond incomprehensible to me.</p>
<p>The subsequent chapters, discussing circuits V-VIII, become very weird: according to RAW, the neurogenetic circuit VI would allow our brain to read into our DNA to understand our genetic history and tap into “previous lives”; the non-local quantum circuit VIII can supposedly connect us with the quantum foam of the universe, allowing for extra-sensory perception, astral projections etc. I’m really trying to keep an open mind, but most of this part of the book seems to be highly** speculative bordering on complete garbage, based on several misreadings of ideas from quantum physics like Bell’s theorem. My view is that the brain is indeed an exceedingly complicated structure whose limits we haven’t reached (let alone explored), yet those limits do exist and are constrained by biology, chemistry and physics. Some of circuit V-VIII capabilities do seem plausible: there is growing evidence that breathing techniques and certain yoga practices can materially improve health outcomes (see the Huberman Lab podcast), supporting RAW’s description of the neurosomatic circuit V. The chapter on metaprogramming (circuit VII) was especially interesting to me: the ultimate expression of neural plasticity and self-awareness should be our ability to actively change our circuits.</p>
<p>But for all the “genius” of the book, RAW’s arguments often depend on more or less factual claims which are often suspect, like the quantum physics example alluded to above. With a hat tip to Gell-Mann amnesia, I should probably assume that the same is true of his psychoanalysis. Another thing: almost all of RAWs predictions are <em>very</em> wrong: commercial life extension by 1998, widespread genetic editing in humans by 2004, large scale space colonisation by 2028.</p>
<p>Yet at the end of the day, it matters little to me whether RAW is right or wrong – the book stretched my mind in a way that the n+1th book on “rational decision-making” simply couldn’t, giving me a new framework to understand the world. <em>Prometheus Rising</em> is about deep introspection – not purely the rationalist kind where we try to understand our cognitive biases and improve our rational decision-making, but rather a meta-introspection wherein we seek to analyse why we are rationalists or moralists or security-seeking in the first place. RAW’s criticisms of rationalism were thought-provoking and incisive: for instance, “rationalist” scientists historically have a very poor track record of accepting new paradigms (Kuhn). As Max Planck said, “science progresses funeral by funeral”.</p>
<p>Some may bristle at the idea that our brains can be modelled as computers running programs, and that we are slaves to our imprints and instincts. But when the computer reaches a level of sophistication wherein it can understand its own program, and further still, modify the program – then it can unleash the full power of the flame of Prometheus.</p>

<p>As Dr. Leonard Orr has noted, the human mind behaves as if it were divided into two parts, the Thinker and the Prover. The Thinker can think about virtually anything. History shows that it can think the earth is suspended on the backs of infinite turtles or that the Earth is hollow, or that the Earth is floating in space;* (loc 236)</p>
<p>The Prover is a much simpler mechanism. It operates on one law only: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. (loc 246)</p>

<p>Science achieves, or approximates, objectivity not because the individual scientist is immune from the psychological laws that govern the rest of us, but because scientific method — a group creation — eventually overrides individual prejudices, in the long run. (loc 269)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In the long run, we are hopefully approximating closer and closer to “objective Truth” over the centuries. In the short run, Orr’s law always holds: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover will prove.* (loc 278)</p>

<p>The Aristotelian idea that to understand something you must know what it is has been abandoned in one science after another, for the pragmatic reason that the simple word “is” introduces so many metaphysical assumptions that we can argue forever about them. In the most advanced sciences, such as mathematical physics, nobody talks about what anything is anymore. They talk about what model (or map) can best be used to understand whatever we are investigating. (loc 336)</p>
<p><em>Reminds me of the Sufi saying: You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand “and.”</em></p>

<p>When the accumulated facts, gimmicks, tools, techniques and gadgets of neuro-science — the science of brain change and brain liberation — reaches a certain critical mass, we will all be able to free ourselves from these robot cycles. (loc 955)</p>

<p>Each set of programs consists of four basic parts: 1. Genetic Imperatives. Totally hard-wired programs or “instincts.” 2. Imprints. These are more-or-less hard wired programs which the brain is genetically designed to accept only at certain points in its development. These points are known, in ethology, as times of imprint vulnerability. 3. Conditioning. These are programs built onto the imprints. They are looser and fairly easy to change with counter-conditioning. 4. Learning. This is even looser and “softer” than conditioning. In general, the primordial imprint can always over-rule any subsequent conditioning or learning. An imprint is a species of software that has become built-in hardware, being impressed on the tender neurons when they are peculiarly open and vulnerable. Imprints (software frozen into hardware) are the non-negotiable aspects of our individuality. Out of the infinity of possible programs existing as potential software, the imprint establishes the limits, parameters, perimeters within which all subsequent conditioning and learning occurs. (loc 379)</p>
<p><em>It is basically a factual question as to how much imprints physically change the hardware. I don’t know enough about neuroscience to comment.</em></p>

<p>Stevenson, McGovern and other darlings of the intelligentsia were speaking to the third circuit, which is not very highly developed in most domesticated primates yet. Eisenhower in his Fatherly way, and Nixon in his bullying Big Brother way, knew just how to push the right Second-Circuit emotional-territorial buttons to get a mob of primates to follow them.

<p>Each of us has a “favorite” circuit — that is, a circuit that has been more heavily imprinted than the others. Miscommunication, misunderstanding and general misjudgment of one another is vastly increased by the fact that few of us know about these levels of circuitry, and we all tend to assume that the person we are interacting with is on the same circuit we are. (loc 1627)</p>

<p>Thus, there are narcissistic (oral) first-circuit types in every social group. Present them with a problem and they will immediately look for somebody else to handle it, since the oral stage is robotically imprinted for dependency. (Or, if they have imprinted hostile weakness instead of dependent weakness, they will explode into anger — infantile tantrum — raging that a problem exists and that it has been imposed on them.) A second-circuit type, in the same situation, will attempt to frighten the problem away by barking and blustering at it, mammalian-fashion. A third-circuit type will try to reason out the problem. This is the best approach only with problems that are themselves rational, i.e., “How do you make this machine work?” It can be blind, and futile, when the “problem” is another human being acting out one of the more destructive second-circuit rage programs. (“The liberal is the one who leaves the room when the fight starts,” somebody once said. Third-circuit types are most confused and feel impotent when second-circuit mammalian politics takes over the scene.) A fourth-circuit type will try to be rational (third circuit) and to sense the emotional dimensions of the problem (second circuit) but will basically try to impose a moral solution: “Now this is the decent, fair thing to do . . .” This may or may not make sense to the third-circuit Rationalist, looking for objective justice; and it will usually make no sense at all to the totally second-circuit type dominated by emotionalism and territoriality. (loc 1630)</p>

<p>if prevented from “leaving the room when the fight starts,” the Rationalist will even descend to second-circuit mammalian howling and barking, under sufficient pressure. (Oliver Wendell Holmes referred to this as “the hydrostatic principle in controversy,” whereby the fools drag everybody down to their own level.) (loc 1644)</p>

<p>The Greek myth of Prometheus Bound — the Titan who brought Light to humanity and is eternally punished for it — is the synecdoche, the perfect symbol, of how the third circuit has been handled in most human societies. The peculiar way most societies have imprinted the fourth, socio-sexual circuit — the weird taboos which restrain us all, in every tribe, however technologically “advanced” — is part of the acceleration-deceleration dialectic. The fourth circuit has been largely imprinted to serve as a brake, holding back the free activity of the time-binding semantic circuit. This is the historical function of taboos and “morality.” (loc 1322)</p>

<p>Tim [O’Leary] saw the reawakening of the body coming first (circuit five). Next the brain reawakened (circuit six - metaprogramming). Then the DNA reawakened (circuit seven - DNA consciousness). Finally the quantum world reawakened (circuit eight). (loc 3470)</p>

<p>“playfulness” is a marked characteristic of all conspicuously healthy individuals of the sort Maslow calls “self-actualizers.” If this initial imprint is negative — if the universe in general and other humans in particular are imprinted as dangerous, hostile and frightening — the Prover will go on throughout life adjusting all perceptions to fit this map. This is what is known as the “Injustice Collector” syndrome (in the language of Dr. Edmund Bergler). The female members of this imprint group become Radical Feminists; (loc 592)</p>

We hear nothing of Jesus (save a few fables) until the age of 30, when he experiences a rapid brain-change, and puts forth a doctrine that is to overturn the Roman Empire and influence Western Civilization until the present. St. Paul, who took the teaching of Jesus and turned it into a militant movement, suffered an extreme form of brain-change, of which he tells us that he was temporarily struck blind and lifted up into the heavens where he beheld things “of which it is not lawful to speak.” On all else but the experience of Illumination they disagree.

<p>Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness. It is quite easy to determine if the Fifth Circuit has been activated successfully or not.

Paired with <a href="/?books=deep-work" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Deep Work</a>, the book is a valuable reminder about how dangerous modern technology can be. Some of the brightest minds on the planet are paid millions by social media companies to marginally improve the addictiveness of the software, based on deep research into our neurobiology and a scary understanding of our cognitive biases. I am reminded of a thought I had when reading <a href="/?books=snow-crash" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Snow Crash</a>: these apps have been engineered to hack into our brain: our dopamine system via variable rewards; our need to belong to a tribe via external triggers (e.g the notification badge that drives FOMO).</p>
<p>As a society, we have not had time to develop generational wisdom on how to have a healthy relationship with technology – it’s difficult for our parents to teach us about good tech habits (like they do with e.g diet, socialisation) when they themselves are addicted. Awareness of manipulative tactics is the first step to dulling their importance. I’m not sure whether to be optimistic or pessimistic about humanity’s relationship with technology. On the one hand, the metaverse is a brand new battlefield and if history is anything to go by, tech companies will have the upper hand compared to reactive regulators. On the other hand, there seems to be growing awareness of the power that big social media companies have over us and there are signs of resistance e.g Apple’s push to privacy-by-default and web3 (arguably).</p>
<p>If you’re building a consumer startup or trying to increase engagement for some product, <em>Hooked</em> is clearly a valuable read. There are actionable insights at the end of every chapter, and Chapter 8 provides a playbook for building a habit-forming product. I suppose it’s a little strange that <em>Hooked</em> explicitly provides a how-to guide for people trying to make habit-forming products, given their negative impacts, but Eyal points out an optimistic alternative perspective: that by learning the techniques of these masters of addiction, we can engineer structures that allow us to build positive habits. This is something that I’m personally excited to explore in the context of personal knowledge management, reading habits, and productivity.</p>

<p>Cognitive psychologists define habits as “automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues”: things we do with little or no conscious thought. The products and services we use habitually alter our everyday behavior, just as their designers intended. Our actions have been engineered. (loc 44)</p>
<p><em>“Things we do with little or no conscious thought” is a pretty scary definition.</em></p>

<p>When technologies are new, people are often skeptical. Old habits die hard and few people have the foresight to see how new innovations will eventually change their routines. However, by looking to early adopters who have already developed nascent behaviors, entrepreneurs and designers can identify niche use cases, which can be taken mainstream. (loc 2070)</p>

<p>[Fogg model]</p>
<p>Every behavior is driven by one of three Core Motivators: seeking pleasure and avoiding pain; seeking hope and avoiding fear; seeking social acceptance while avoiding social rejection. Ability is influenced by the six factors of time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routineness. Ability is dependent on users and their context at that moment.

<p>Variable reward is the third phase of the Hook Model, and there are three types of variable rewards: the tribe, the hunt, and the self.</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Rewards of the tribe is the search for social rewards fueled by connectedness with other people.</li>

<p>recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards. (loc 1051)</p>

<p>By running on two feet and lacking the body hair typical of other primates, our species gained a massive advantage over larger mammals. Our ability to maintain steady pursuit gave us the capacity to hunt large prehistoric game. Yet persistence hunting was not only made possible because of our bodies; changes in our brains also played a significant role. (loc 1129)</p>
<p><em>Author is arguing that our brain rewards the effort of the hunt in order to keep our bodies motivated during steady pursuit.</em></p>

<p>E-mail, for example, utilizes all three variable reward types. What subconsciously compels us to check our e-mail? First, there is uncertainty concerning who might be sending us a message. We have a social obligation to respond to e-mails and a desire to be seen as agreeable (rewards of the tribe). We may also be curious about what information is in the e-mail: Perhaps something related to our career or business awaits us? Checking e-mail informs us of opportunities or threats to our material possessions and livelihood (rewards of the hunt). Lastly, e-mail is in itself a task—challenging us to sort, categorize, and act to eliminate unread messages. We are motivated by the uncertain nature of our fluctuating e-mail count and feel compelled to gain control of our in-box (rewards of the self). (loc 1362)</p>
<p><em>Superhuman is a good case study: they focused on the rewards of the hunt by reducing load times (100ms rule), and rewards of the self by encouraging inbox zero.</em></p>

<p>Investments in a product create preferences because of our tendency to overvalue our work, be consistent with past behaviors, and avoid cognitive dissonance. Investment comes after the variable reward phase, when users are primed to reciprocate. Investments increase the likelihood of users returning by improving the service the more it is used. They enable the accrual of stored value in the form of content, data, followers, reputation, or skill. Investments increase the likelihood of users passing through the Hook again by loading the next trigger to start the cycle all over again. (loc 1660)</p>

<p>An entire chapter is devoted to a list of potential edges – it goes without saying that this is rare in finance. The main reason why Sinclair can get away with this is that capturing edges in the option space is highly nontrivial: there is presumably plenty of secret sauce in strike selection and position management.</p>
<p>The chapter on Bet Sizing is great: combined with the similar chapter in <a href="/?books=volatility-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Volatility Trading</a>, Sinclair has created a phenomenal resource on Kelly betting, covering the strengths/weaknesses, as well as the rarely-discussed topic of parameter uncertainty.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosy comfort]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hygge (pronounced “hoo-guh”) is the Danish word for cosiness and comfort – the feeling of being wrapped in a soft blanket in front of a fireplace when it’s snowing outside. Beyond the purely physical, it is a mental state of presence, belonging, and togetherness.</p>
<p>In many areas of my life, I aspire to efficiency and pragmatism (and in a strange way, this in itself makes me happy). I picked up this book in an attempt to create more balance: adding deliberate inefficiency to help me “draw meaning from the fabric of ordinary living”. There is a lot to learn from the Danes regarding comfort and style – how they create spaces and social experiences that emphasise shelter, connection, and contentment. At the same time, too much hygge seems boring to me. The author describes how hygge pervades Danish culture, praising the uniformity and stability of life there. Comfort and contentment matter, but I want the vibrance of the real world, the ups and downs that life has to offer, rather than monotone cosiness. Hygge seems antithetical to progress and self-improvement.</p>
<p>The book itself is unfocused, filled with lots of feel-good statements about what hygge is. To that end, it is probably unsuccessful as a rigorous exploration of the philosophy of hygge. Instead, I think the author intends the reading of the book to be a hyggelig experience in itself; filled with beautiful images and warm quotes, it’s an ideal book to read in a comfy chair on a winter’s day.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>To hygge is to invite intimacy and connection. It’s a feeling of engagement and relatedness, of belonging to the moment and to each other. Hygge is a sense of abundance and contentment. Hygge is about being, not having.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There is a bedrock of contentment beneath everyday life in Denmark that is more stable than the waves of happiness that flow above it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hygge is mindfulness more akin to noticing than contemplation, a quality of stillness born of contentment and awareness.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Accepting that hygge is a fleeting enchantment and that we will have to move beyond the pleasure of the moment is almost a precondition for enjoying the experience. We don’t hygge to be content; we find contentment in hygge.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In hygge there is an element of serenity in the recognition that we cannot quite grasp the mysterious character of the world, but choose to let go and simply let things be as they are.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Keeping certain places protected and dedicated for special activities facilitates hygge – an armchair in a corner set aside for reading, a table left uncluttered to enjoy our hobbies.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hygge rekindles our awareness of the importance and pleasure of mutuality and celebrates our interconnectedness. It keeps us engaged with the lifelong task of living in intimate and loving relation to the world around us.</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-scout-mindset"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We believe what we want to be true]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Scout Mindset</em> is my new go-to book recommendation for people interested in an introduction to decision-making and “applied rationality”. It is delightfully accessible and informative without being culty or condescending (which can be rare for this genre).</p>
<p>One of the book’s key concepts is <strong>motivated reasoning</strong> – a subset of confirmation bias in which we more readily believe something we wish to be true, and similarly, have harsher standards of evidence for things we wish to be false – “can I believe this” vs “must I believe this”. Scout mindset is the opposite: aiming to have an accurate view of reality regardless of what you want to be true.</p>
<p>Rather than just explaining why we are flawed decision-makers and telling us how to fix it, Galef provides quite an empathetic take, walking us through the psychological and social reasons for motivated reasoning. In this vein, she also deftly addresses common concerns, like the idea that self-deception leads to happiness, making a persuasive case that scout mindset is something to aspire to.</p>
<p>Having established this, Galef provides highly practical methods for avoiding motivated reasoning – little thought experiments that we can use when analysing situations. For example, the Conformity test: if nobody else held this view, would you still hold it?</p>
<p><em>The Scout Mindset</em> is a fantastic launching point. For people who find themselves inspired by the book and want to learn more about applied rationality, several of the other works Galef references (e.g <a href="/?books=superforecasting" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Superforecasting</a>, <a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>) are good followups.</p>

<p>I were to name one single facet I find most inspiring, it’s the idea of being intellectually honorable: wanting the truth to win out, and putting that principle above your own ego. (loc 3216)</p>

<p>The problem with identity is that it wrecks your ability to think clearly. Identifying with a belief makes you feel like you have to be ready to defend it, which motivates you to focus your attention on collecting evidence in its favor. Identity makes you reflexively reject arguments that feel like attacks on you or the status of your group. (loc 2780)</p>
<p>Holding an identity lightly means thinking of it in a matter-of-fact way, rather than as a central source of pride and meaning in your life. It’s a description, not a flag to be waved proudly. (loc 2810)</p>

<p>The best description of motivated reasoning I’ve ever seen comes from psychologist Tom Gilovich. When we want something to be true, he said, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe this?,” searching for an excuse to accept it. When we don’t want something to be true, we instead ask ourselves, “Must I believe this?,” searching for an excuse to reject it. (loc 168)</p>

<p>“What function does motivated reasoning serve?” I’ve broken it down into six overlapping categories: comfort, self-esteem, morale, persuasion, image, and belonging. (loc 335)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We use motivated reasoning not because we don’t know any better, but because we’re trying to protect things that are vitally important to us—our ability to feel good about our lives and ourselves, our motivation to try hard things and stick with them, our ability to look good and persuade, and our acceptance in our communities. (loc 482)</p>

<p>If directionally motivated reasoning is like being a soldier fighting off threatening evidence, accuracy motivated reasoning is like being a scout forming a map of the strategic landscape. What’s beyond that next hill? Is that a bridge over the river or are my eyes deceiving me? Where are the dangers, the shortcuts, the opportunities? What areas do I need more information about? How reliable is my intel? (loc 257)</p>

<p>If knowledge and intelligence protect you from motivated reasoning, then we would expect to find that the more people know about science, the more they agree with each other about scientific questions. Kahan found the opposite. (loc 729)</p>

<p>Feeling reasonable, being smart and knowledgeable, being aware of motivated reasoning—all these things seem like they should be indicators of scout mindset, yet they have surprisingly little to do with it. (loc 779)</p>

<p>You can’t detect motivated reasoning in yourself just by scrutinizing your reasoning and concluding that it makes sense. You have to compare your reasoning to the way you would have reasoned in a counterfactual world, a world in which your motivations were different—would you judge that politician’s actions differently if he was in the opposite party?

<p><em>Equivalent bets</em></p>
<p>I can bet on self-driving cars, and get $10,000 if they’re on the market in a year. Alternately, I can take the “ball bet”: I’m given a box containing four balls, one of which is gray. I reach in and pull out one ball, without looking—if it’s gray, I win $10,000. (loc 1308)</p>

<p>The ideological Turing test, suggested by economist Bryan Caplan, is based on similar logic. It’s a way to determine if you really understand an ideology: Can you explain it as a believer would, convincingly enough that other people couldn’t tell the difference between you and a genuine believer? (loc 2861)</p>
<p>The ideological Turing test is typically seen as a test of your knowledge: How thoroughly do you understand the other side’s beliefs? But it also serves as an emotional test: Do you hold your identity lightly enough to be able to avoid caricaturing your ideological opponents? (loc 2889)</p>

<p>Being rationally irrational, therefore, would mean that we’re good at unconsciously choosing just enough epistemic irrationality to achieve our social and emotional goals, without impairing our judgment too much. A rationally irrational person would deny problems only when the comfort of denial is sufficiently high and their chance of fixing the problem is sufficiently low. (loc 548)</p>

<p>We overestimate the importance of how we come across to other people. Social costs like looking weird or making a fool out of ourselves feel a lot more significant than they actually are.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Diary of a Very Bad Year</em> is an engaging retrospective on the Global Financial Crisis, told through a series of interviews with an anonymous hedge fund manager (HFM).</p>
<p>Humans are excellent at rationalising events after the fact, which makes me naturally sceptical of books like <em>The Big Short.</em> Entertaining and informative as they may be, it’s hard to know the extent to which the conviction of the characters is flavoured by hindsight. We want to believe that there were renegades like Steve Eisman and Michael Burry who had clear prophetic insights into the future, but the reality is probably more sober – they made decisions under uncertainty based on careful analysis, and while the expected value of the bets may have been positive, they weren’t sure winners by any means.</p>
<p>By contrast, the play-by-play commentary in <em>Diary</em> structurally reduces hindsight bias. We get to see the spectrum of things that HFM is thinking about at any given time, with little room for the construction of post-hoc narratives. In the footnotes, HFM annotates how his predictions played out in real life, and he’s wrong quite a lot (as Steve Cohen says, his best traders get it right 56% of the time). I enjoyed this aspect of the book because it provides a better picture of reality, highlighting the difficulties of making decisions in a very uncertain world. I’m reminded of early 2020 – many people now say it was absolutely obvious that the Fed would step in, yet if truly were obvious, we wouldn’t have seen such a steep selloff/rebound in the first place. We use platitudes like “don’t fight the Fed” to delude ourselves into thinking that there wasn’t any doubt about these things.</p>
<p>One downside of this format is that because the interviews happened “live”, there is less insight into actual trades that the manager has on (for privacy and disclosure reasons) – but in my mind, this is a fair tradeoff for having the “frontline” perspective in real-time.</p>
<p>The interviews themselves are enjoyable to read; the vibe of HFM concords with my personal observations of the talent in the industry: rational and thoughtful people with a sharp sense of humour, especially of the self-deprecating kind.</p>
<p>The book is relatively technical – HFM uses classic trading jargon – but the layperson interviewer does a good job of keeping things accessible to the keen amateur. Worth reading for a different perspective on the GFC – I’d love to read books of this format for other big market events.</p>

<p>That a mind so excellent, so generous, so curious, should spend all its time on relative value trading in foreign jurisdictions and yelling at people who refuse to pay him back—well, as HFM says, that is a philosophical question, and beyond the purview of the mere bond market. (loc 76)</p>

<p>It wasn’t so much the direct effect of Lehman that caused the markets to have the sort of total seizure that they did for some period in the beginning of October. It was something a little bit more indirect. Lehman was a big issuer of commercial paper—short-dated, unsecured paper—that tends to be bought by money market funds. (loc 1088)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When Lehman went under, people who had shares of the Reserve Primary Fund, especially institutional investors who were very much on top of what Primary’s holdings were, started to ask for redemptions from that fund. So that led to a run on that money market fund. (loc 1093)</p>

<p>As a result, you worry, “Well, will people take all their money out of money market funds? They’re not depositing any money in. The whole commercial paper market may grind to a halt.” And the commercial paper market is really the lifeblood of short-term credit, short-term corporate credit, in this country. (loc 1101)</p>

<p>It caused a lot of damage. It caused the short-term credit markets to seize up, which interfered with trade; it caused forced selling in the stock market, because you have some hedge funds who are dependent on short-term credit, you had people just panicking and taking their money out of mutual funds…it just led to, overall, a reevaluation of the line between cash and not-cash.

<p>People don’t know what these instruments are worth. Like an asset-backed bond—what’s it worth? Nobody knows what it’s worth; there isn’t a market for this anymore. It’s not like there are three bond issues and that’s it; there are thousands, and each one is backed by thousands of mortgages. It just becomes an information-processing problem. You simply can’t prove to me in a reasonable amount of time that everything’s fine. (loc 560)</p>

<p>they were long the senior tranches many times the amount that they were short the more junior tranches. Because, you know, “What’s going to happen is the junior tranches will be utterly destroyed, and the senior tranches will decline maybe a little bit, but I can kind of make the trade so that it’s carry-neutral.” And the assumption is that the senior tranches will be much less sensitive, will move a lot less. But what happened is that because every hedge fund had that trade on, or so many hedge funds had that trade on, and had to liquidate (loc 1437)</p>

<p>There’s this professor at Princeton named Edward Tenner, he writes a lot about safety technology, and he says that a lot of safety technology, it doesn’t actually make things safer; it’s about trading off catastrophic risks against chronic risks. He uses the example of rigid molded ski boots. Before you had these boots, if you had a problem, the problem was rare, but you broke your leg or ankle catastrophically. With modern boots, people very rarely break their legs anymore, but they more frequently wind up with knee ligament damage, so it’s a chronic problem. (loc 1790)</p>
<p>I think when you’re talking about government intervention, it’s kind of in the other direction: It’s more broadly about trading off rare and catastrophic risks against chronic risks. So if a higher-than-usual unemployment and slow economy is something like a chronic risk, the government can deal with that by borrowing and spending on stimulus. (loc 1794)</p>

<p>the theory we had at the desk here is that the Treasury Department—not the Fed, the Fed’s not so tough, but the Treasury Department—went to the top guys at Bear and said: “Either a deal gets done that saves Bear and calms the financial system by the end of this weekend, or we will find some reason to put you in jail.” And I think one of the things that every officer of a public company is very sensitive to, post-Enron, is jail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mind viruses, Neurolingusitc hacking, and Sumerian mythology]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I picked up <em>Snow Crash</em> in an attempt to better understand the metaverse (a term which Stephenson coined!). Metaverse is in vogue right now, in no small part due to Mark Zuckerberg, and I think sci-fi is a good source of speculation for potential future paths.</p>
<p>That said, the most interesting aspect of the book was not the metaverse stuff, but rather the discussion of mind viruses.</p>
<p>One of the key plot ideas is “neurolinguistic hacking” – the idea that we have deep neural circuits in our brains (inaccessible to our higher cognition) that can be “hacked” with the right stimulus. This thread about the programmability of the human mind – and thus the vulnerability of the human mind to “mind viruses” was utterly fascinating. It is masterfully weaved with Sumerian mythology and ancient history: in Stephenson’s semi-fictional view, the story of the Tower of Babel (in which the Lord caused everyone to speak different languages) could have been the product of a “mind virus”. It’s hard to know how much of this is pure fiction, as opposed to genuine left-field speculation on historical events, but in either case, it is absolutely delightful – feels vaguely similar to the mysterious and conspiratorial reinterpretations of the historical evidence that constitute the only redeeming feature of Dan Brown novels (see e.g <a href="/?books=the-da-vinci-code" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Da Vinci Code</a>).</p>
<p>A core theme of <em>Snow Crash</em> is that the metaverse can affect reality – a mind virus caught in the metaverse can cause the operating system of the brain to crash. While perhaps too fanciful, this is certainly more applicable than ever: arguably social media companies, having poured vast sums of money into psychological research, have already figured out how to hack into our subconscious. It’s scary to think about what they could achieve if they controlled ever more sensory input.</p>
<p>While the ideas in <em>Snow Crash</em> are intricate and fascinating, the novel is pretty bizarre. There are several story arcs that are just weird and out-of-place (e.g the affair between the 15yo protagonist and one of the main antagonists); the world-building feels clumsy at times (it is as confusing as that of <a href="/?books=neuromancer" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Neuromancer</a> without creating a vibe in the same way); the exposition of the ideas is very forced – Hiro converses with a digital librarian to figure everything out – though it’s strange for me to fault that because these library scenes were my favourite parts of the book. So it’s worth a read, but only if you’re interested in the funky neurolinguistic hacking concepts.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<p><em>The core argument of the book is rather intricate. I have done my best to sketch it out below. As I mention in the review above, I don’t know if there’s any validity to these ideas, but they are very interesting nonetheless!</em></p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The brain contains deep neural structures for language processing.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">At some point in the distant past, we were infected by a metavirus that made us susceptible to new viruses. This was the Fall of Man from Paradise (many religions/cultures have some version of the fall)<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">perhaps this metavirus came as information from space, or perhaps it intrinsically evolves in a complex system</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">these viruses consist of both mind viruses and biological viruses – the two are closely related e.g. herpes simplex actually modifies brain cells.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Language shapes the brain. Sumerian was a structured and powerful language, so mind viruses were highly susceptible for people whose brains were shaped by Sumerian.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Primitive societies were controlled by verbal “programs” called <em>me</em> , procedures that their neural substructures would follow algorithmically (e.g. how to plant seeds).<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">these people weren’t conscious in the way that we are</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">these <em>me</em> are mind viruses – they get propagated and shared, due to the high susceptibility caused by the Sumerian language.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">a Temple was a database of <em>me</em> , and the priest (<em>en</em> ) would administrate these programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Enki was the first “neurolinguistic hacker” – he understood how to tap into people’s deep language structures, and was thus able to program new <em>me</em> .<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Enki wrote a countervirus called the <em>nam-shub</em> of Enki that broke humanity out of the program-execution rut, and in so doing, caused the Babel event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The Asherah virus is a biological virus (similar to herpes simplex) that infects the cells of the brain stem, bringing the deep neural substructures closer to the surface, and making people more susceptible to <em>me</em> (mind viruses).<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Enki’s Babel event created diversity in brain structures, increasing society’s robustness to viruses like Asherah</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">several thousand years later, the Deuteronomists weaponised the Hebrew language to fight against Asherah.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">rational religions encouraged information hygiene (e.g. carefully copying the Torah, insisting that the Quran is the exact word of God), needed to prevent the spread of Asherah</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">but Asherah kept resurging, e.g. the Pharisees revived the strictly dogmatic Sumerian system; Pentecost – speaking in tongues – was another resurgence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">In the book, L. Bob Rife wants to spread the Asherah virus so he can control everyone using <em>me</em> . Hackers, who may be more resistant to the Asherah virus, can be neutralised with binary viruses.</li>

<p>who is Asherah?” “She was the consort of El, who is also known as Yahweh,” the Librarian says. “She also was known by other names: Elat, her most common epithet. The Greeks knew her as Dione or Rhea. The Canaanites knew her as Tannit or Hawwa, which is the same thing as Eve.” (loc 3693)</p>

<p>“I don&#39;t remember anything about God having a wife in the Bible.” “The Bible didn&#39;t exist at that point. Judaism was just a loose collection of Yahwistic cults, each with different shrines and practices. The stories about the Exodus hadn&#39;t been formalized into scripture yet. And the later parts of the Bible had not yet happened.” “Who decided to purge Asherah from Judaism?” “The deuteronomic school—defined, by convention, as the people who wrote the book of Deuteronomy as well as Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.” (loc 3703)</p>

<p>“Egypt was a civilization of stone. They made their art and architecture of stone, so it lasts forever. But you can&#39;t write on stone. So they invented papyrus and wrote on that.

<p>the predeuteronomic law said nothing about a monarch. The Law as laid down by the deuteronomic school reflected a monarchist system. The predeuteronomic law was largely concerned with sacred matters, while the deuteronomic law&#39;s main concern is the education of the king and his people—secular matters in other words. The deuteronomists insisted on centralizing the religion in the Temple in Jerusalem, destroying the outlying cult centers.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>“the deuteronomists codified the religion. Made it into an organized, self-propagating entity,” Hiro says. “I don&#39;t want to say virus. But according to what you just quoted me, the Torah is like a virus. It uses the human brain as a host. The host—the human—makes copies of it.

<p>There are two schools: relativists and universalists. As George Steiner summarizes it, relativists tend to believe that language is not the vehicle of thought but its determining medium. It is the framework of cognition. Our perceptions of everything are organized by the flux of sensations passing over that framework. Hence, the study of the evolution of language is the study of the evolution of the human mind itself.” (loc 4471)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“In contrast with the relativists, who believe that languages need not have anything in common with each other, the universalists believe that if you can analyze languages enough, you can find that all of them have certain traits in common. So they analyze languages, looking for such traits.” “Have they found any?” “No. There seems to be an exception to every rule.” (loc 4475)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>according to the universalists, French and English—or any other languages—must share certain traits that have their roots in the ‘deep structures&#39; of the human brain. According to Chomskyan theory, the deep structures are innate components of the brain that enable it to carry out certain formal kinds of operations on strings of symbols. Or, as Steiner paraphrases Emmon Bach: These deep structures eventually lead to the actual patterning of the cortex with its immensely ramified yet, at the same time, ‘programmed&#39; network of electrochemical and neurophysiological channels.” (loc 4486)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Lagos modified the strict Chomskyan theory by supposing that learning a language is like blowing code into PROMs—an analogy that I cannot interpret.” “The analogy is clear. PROMs are Programmable Read-Only Memory chips,” Hiro says. “When they come from the factory, they have no content. Once and only once, you can place information into those chips and then freeze it—the information, the software, becomes frozen into the chip—it transmutes into hardware. After you have blown the code into the PROMs, you can read it out, but you can&#39;t write to them anymore. So Lagos was trying to say that the newborn human brain has no structure—as the relativists would have it—and that as the child learns a language, the developing brain structures itself accordingly, the language gets ‘blown into&#39; the hardware and becomes a permanent part of the brain&#39;s deep structure—as the universalists would have it.” (loc 4498)</p>

<p>In many parts of the world, you will find people of the same ethnic group, living a few miles apart in similar valleys under similar conditions, speaking languages that have absolutely nothing in common with each other. This sort of thing is not an oddity—it is ubiquitous. Many linguists have tried to understand Babel, the question of why human language tends to fragment, rather than converging on a common tongue.” (loc 3528)</p>

<p>[Herpes simplex] takes up residence in the nervous system and never leaves. It is capable of carrying new genes into existing neurons and genetically reengineering them. Modern gene therapists use it for this purpose. Lagos thought that herpes simplex might be a modern, benign descendant of Asherah.” (loc 3745)</p>
<p>“So did Lagos think that the Asherah virus actually altered the DNA of brain cells?” “Yes. This was the backbone of his hypothesis that the virus was able to transmute itself from a biologically transmitted string of DNA into a set of behaviors.” (loc 3750)</p>

<p>Lagos believed that [...] Sumerian was a language ideally suited to the creation and propagation of viruses. That a virus, once released into Sumer, would spread rapidly and virulently, until it had infected everyone.” “Maybe Enki knew that also,” Hiro says. “Maybe the nam-shub of Enki wasn&#39;t such a bad thing.

A distant memory of this event is preserved in legends of the Fall from Paradise, in which mankind was ejected from a life of ease into a world infested with disease and pain. (loc 6436)</p>

<p>No matter how smart we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes us potential hosts for self-replicating information. But being physically infected with a virulent strain of the Asherah virus makes you a whole lot more susceptible. The only thing that keeps these things from taking over the world is the Babel factor—the walls of mutual incomprehension that compartmentalize the human race and stop the spread of viruses. (loc 6486)</p>

<p>Under the right conditions, your ears—or eyes—can tie into the deep structures, bypassing the higher language functions. Which is to say, someone who knows the right words can speak words, or show you visual symbols, that go past all your defenses and sink right into your brainstem. (loc 6411)</p>

<p>“The Sumerian word for ‘mind,&#39; or ‘wisdom,&#39; is identical to the word for ‘ear.&#39; That&#39;s all those people were: ears with bodies attached. Passive receivers of information. But Enki was different. Enki was an <em>en</em> who just happened to be especially good at his job. He had the unusual ability to write new <em>me</em> —he was a hacker. (loc 6451)</p>

<p>“At some point, Enki realized that Sumer was stuck in a rut. People were carrying out the same old <em>me</em> all the time, not coming up with new ones, not thinking for themselves. I suspect that he was lonely, being one of the few—perhaps the only—conscious human being in the world. He realized that in order for the human race to advance, they had to be delivered from the grip of this viral civilization. “So he created the nam-shub of Enki, a countervirus that spread along the same routes as the me and the metavirus. It went into the deep structures of the brain and reprogrammed them. Henceforth, no one could understand the Sumerian language, or any other deep structure-based language. Cut off from our common deep structures, we began to develop new languages that had nothing in common with each other. The <em>me</em> no longer worked and it was not possible to write new <em>me</em> . Further transmission of the metavirus was blocked.” (loc 6454)</p>

<p>Babel is a gateway in our minds, a gateway that was opened by the nam-shub of Enki that broke us free from the metavirus and gave us the ability to think—moved us from a materialistic world to a dualistic world—a binary world—with both a physical and a spiritual component. (loc 6465)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Ask Your Developer</em> is an excellent read on business strategy from the rare CEO who actually codes. The key theme in the book is that, for many companies, software is now a profit centre rather than a cost centre – it is a source of competitive advantage. This means that it should be done in-house, rather than being outsourced. But that begs the question: how do you run a software-centric organisation, attracting dev talent and maximising their value?</p>
<p>Lawson, being both a CEO and a developer, is in the perfect place to answer this. He believes that software development is a creative activity. Therefore, you should give devs problems, rather than just a list of program specifications. Build a customer-centric culture where devs go out of their way to try to solve problems for their users</p>
<p>In addition to discussing macro tech trends and mental models for thinking about software developments, Lawson spends a great deal of time discussing how he organises teams – this was my favourite part of the book. His philosophy, based on his experience at Amazon, is to organise the company into small teams (at most 10 people), each of which acts like a startup, that provides services for the other teams in the company.</p>
<p>There are some nice links between this organisational philosophy and the field of complex systems. Complex systems are often hampered by a lack of instant feedback – for example, in firms where software developers never interact with customers. Organising the system into smaller subunits can free up information flow and lead to better outcomes (explained in <a href="/?books=thinking-in-systems" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking in Systems</a>). This technique has been applied in several other variants across history; <a href="/?books=superforecasting" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Superforecasting</a> discusses the auftragstaktik used by the <em>Wehrmacht</em> (to be clear, one can respect the efficiency of the German military while decrying their objectives and deeds), in which the top brass specifies objectives, but leaves implementation down to individual section commanders.</p>
<p><em>Ask Your Developer</em> is short and to-the-point, with extremely clear thinking from a proven operator. Lawson does a fantastic job of summarising his wisdom into one-liners that anyone in a leadership position (tech-related or otherwise) would do well to remember:</p>

<p>The digital revolution is fundamentally rewriting the rules of general management. Software simultaneously lowers transaction costs, demolishes barriers to entry, and accelerates the pace of change. Companies—and institutions—that cannot cope with this pace and intensity will cease to be relevant. (loc 46)</p>

<p>With AWS it seemed as if Amazon had waved a magic wand and made all of those headaches go away. Sign up, and you need never think about how to run hardware and storage ever again—just pay for what you use. The difference between this model and the first-era model was like the difference between generating electricity with your own diesel generator and buying electricity from a utility company.

<p>The first Apple TV remote had only seven buttons. Why? Because all the smarts of the Apple TV resides in the software running on the device. That means Apple can learn from customers and update the software constantly with new features and functionality. (loc 374)</p>

<p>When you pitch a new product idea to potential customers, one of two things happens, especially when they’re an acquaintance. If they genuinely like the idea and it seems to solve a pain point in their life, they ask you questions. Does it do this? Does it do that? They’re trying to match your solution to their problem. That’s a good sign. (loc 1106)</p>

<p>companies succeed at digital transformation not just by using software but by building software. (loc 178)</p>

<p>But along came the web, and then mobile, and suddenly the interface that most companies had with their customers became digital. Software went from the back of the business to the front. (loc 280)</p>
<p><em>Software is now a differentiating aspect of user experience</em></p>

<p>What technologies are table stakes, and should be bought, and which digital innovations are the differentiators between you and your competition? Dig in on the answers—many of the factors people perceive as differentiating have become table stakes over the last decade. What analog bits of your business should you invest in digitizing? What off-the-shelf software solutions are holding you back? (loc 581)</p>

<p>My rule of thumb is that for anything that gives you differentiation with customers, you should build. Software that faces your customers, you should build. Anything where your customers will be saying, why doesn’t it do X, and your answer is, well, the thing we bought doesn’t do X. That’s a problem. When your customers care, you need to build.

<p>Managers often believe if they articulate their plans in the context of the CEO’s vision, then they’ll get approval. Yet in customer-centric organizations, not strategy-centric or CEO-centric organizations, discussions start with the customer. (loc 3236)</p>

<p>they were to ask you what color they should paint the bike shed outside the nuclear reactor, a large discussion would ensue, with each committee member attempting to add value and express their opinion.

<p>While there are many ways to implement Agile development, they all revolve around three main ideas: anticipating change, chunking up work, and maintaining close collaboration between the business and developers. (loc 3376)</p>

<p>If you have one hundred things that are 10 percent done, the chance that changes will come along and interrupt at least one of those workstreams is great. But if you focus on getting one thing 100 percent complete, then you’re less likely to have to unwind completed work. Agile limits work in progress by breaking work into short sprints, often only two weeks long, with the goal of delivering a working product at the end of each cycle. (loc 3380)</p>
<p><em>Sprints prevent the curse of having 100 half-finished projects</em></p>

<p>Unlike Waterfall, where the work was divided into rows on a Gantt chart (sometimes years) ahead of time with an imperfect set of assumptions, Agile focused on creating manageable work units that are implementable quickly, and only as far out as the current sprint. (loc 3393)</p>

<p>you shouldn’t proceed before developing the idea into a business hypothesis. Without that, you won’t know what your experiment is measuring. Success or failure will be ambiguous, and you’re just left with “Is it moving the needle yet?” To which the answer will almost always be no. (loc 1792)</p>
<p><em>MBA-types play an important role – developers should not be given free-rein either.</em></p>

<p>let’s look at the trickiest situation, the fuzzy middle, where the hypothesis remains in an unproven state, neither true nor false, and your metrics are all over the place. Those are the hardest calls. This is the one actual kind of failure story for a team running an experiment. If your goal is to prove or disprove a hypothesis, and you can’t do either given a reasonable amount of time, then the experiment may actually be failing. This is why clarity of metrics is so important at the onset of an experiment. (loc 1885)</p>

<p>it’s not the failure that’s celebrated, it’s the deep learnings that advance the mission. Failure is merely accepted as a natural consequence of the learning. When people talk about accepting failure, they’re talking about accepting the journey of discovery. (loc 1929)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go-to introductory rec for time series methods]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am beginning to think that one of the necessary conditions for me to enjoy a textbook is that the authors must have practical experience. Without that, you get textbooks that spend far too long introducing (or worse still, proving) different theorems, with little clarity on how the ideas can be applied to the real world.</p>
<p><em>Forecasting: Principles and Practice</em> (the official online version is freely available <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/">here</a>) is squarely in the “practical” camp – Hyndman runs a statistical consulting business, which means that he is incentivised to find things that work (rather than things that are theoretically elegant).</p>
<p>The book is well organised, always providing motivation for a particular technique before diving into the mathematics. For example, Chapter 2 provides a wonderful overview of time series graphics – this alone makes it far more useful than most technical resources on time series.</p>
<p>I’d highly recommend the book to anyone looking for a practical overview of time series methods. Every chapter ends with a “Further Reading” section, pointing the reader to a curated list of resources should they be looking for more information on a particular technique, making the book useful for experienced practitioners and keen amateurs alike.</p>

The caliber of the interviewees is superb and the book is full of wisdom from titans of the hedge fund industry, who are not only excellent traders, but thoughtful individuals with battle-tested mental models and the ability to communicate their knowledge.</p>
<p>One of the things that becomes clear across the <em>Market Wizards</em> series (see <a href="/?books=the-new-market-wizards" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The New Market Wizards</a>) is that while each individual finds their comparative advantage in a different area, they often share the same core beliefs: a strong empirical leaning, control of their emotions, and an almost paranoid focus on not just decision-making, but the decision-making process. My favourite interviews: Colm O’Shea, Jamie Mai, Mike Platt.</p>

<p>[O’Shea] never lets a mistake get remotely close to the point where it would provide a good story. Large trading losses are simply incompatible with his methodology. (loc 203)</p>

<p>markets matter more than policy. You have to look at real fundamentals, not at what policy makers want to happen. The willing disbelief of people can carry on for a long time, but eventually it is overwhelmed by the market. The genius of Soros was recognizing the turning point when things change—the ability to not only know that a position was right, but that it was right now, and that now was the time to have a big risk on the trade. (loc 351)</p>
<p><em>If we look over history, the free market has often “won” when people have tried to restrain it.</em></p>

<p>I try to avoid conceptualizing the market in anthropomorphic terms. Markets don’t think. Just like mobs don’t think. Why did the mob decide to attack that building? Well, the mob didn’t actually think that. The market simply provides a price that comes about through a collection of human beings. (loc 411)</p>

<p>A great Soros quote is “Invest first; investigate later.” You don’t want to get fixated on always needing a nice story for the trade. I am an empiricist at heart. The unfolding reality trumps everything. (loc 434)</p>
<p><em>Perhaps less true in quant, depending on how careful you’ve been with data-mining.</em></p>

<p>George Soros has the least regret of anyone I have ever met. Even though he will sometimes play up to his public image as a guru who knows what is going on, it is in no sense what he does as a money manager. He has no emotional attachment to an idea. When a trade is wrong, he will just cut it, move on, and do something else. (loc 629)</p>

<p>the natural way to trade a market that is in a bubble is from the long side, not the short side. (loc 766)</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>First, you decide where you are wrong. That determines where the stop level should be. Then you work out how much you are willing to lose on the idea. Last, you divide the amount you’re willing to lose by the per-contract loss to the stop point, and that determines your position size. The most common error I see is that people do it backwards. They start with position size. Then they know their pain threshold, and that determines where they place their stop. (loc 861)</p>

<p>In both the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971 and in the Mexico default in 1982, I learned that a crisis development that leads to central banks easing and coming to the rescue can swamp the impact of the crisis itself. (loc 1074)</p>

<p>People think that a thing called correlation exists. That’s wrong. What is really happening is that each market is behaving logically based on its own determinants, and as the nature of those determinants changes, what we call correlation changes.</p>
<p>For example, when economic growth expectations are volatile, stocks and bonds will be negatively correlated because if growth slows, it will cause both stock prices and interest rates to decline. However, in an environment where inflation expectations are volatile, stocks and bonds will be positively correlated because interest rates will go up with higher inflation, which is detrimental to both bonds and stocks.

<p>There are books about the predictive modeling process that specifically caution against “burning the data”—that is, you have to greatly limit the number of combinations you ever try. And I found that advice markedly stupid because I knew I could find a way to try any number of combinations and not overfit the data. You get new out-of-sample data every day. If you are rigorous about acknowledging what that new data is telling you, you can really get somewhere. (loc 2627)</p>

<p>instead of training with the target variable, which is the price change over the subsequent 24 hours, I generate random numbers that have the same distribution characteristics. I know that any models that I find that score well training on this data are 100 percent curve-fitted because they are based on intentionally bogus data. The performance of the best model on the fictitious data provides a baseline. Then, you need to come up with models that do much better than this baseline when you are training on the real data.

<p>Suppose you have a bankroll of $1 million and your maximum tolerable drawdown is $200,000. Then from the Kelly criterion perspective, you don’t have $1 million in capital, you have $200,000. (loc 3447)</p>

<p>Would it be accurate to describe your approach as combining technical trend-following rules with market specific fundamental filters that define favorable and unfavorable environments? Yes. (loc 3718)</p>
<p>The fundamental factors we took into account varied with the market sector. In metal and agricultural markets, the spread structure—whether a market is in backwardation or contango—can be important, as can the amount in storage relative to storage capacity. (loc 3715)</p>

<p>In hindsight, do you think reducing your exposure on drawdowns was a good idea? It all depends on how confident you are about your edge. If you have a really strong conviction about your edge, then the best thing to do is sit there and take your lumps.

<p>finding answers is much easier when you know in advance what the questions are. (loc 4033)</p>

<p>My definition of a special situation is one where a price dislocation has occurred, either at a single company or across an industry, because the market has identified a particular idiosyncratic risk and assigned an uncertainty discount to it. (loc 4038)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Although markets are generally good at estimating the magnitude of a contingent liability, they are often poor at evaluating outcomes probabilistically. (loc 4042)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As a general observation, markets tend to overdiscount the uncertainty related to identified risks. Conversely, markets tend to underdiscount risks that have not yet been expressly identified. Whenever the market is pointing at something and saying this is a risk to be concerned about, in my experience, most of the time, the risk ends up being not as bad as the market anticipated. (loc 4059)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In my experience, however, the single best predictor of future increases of volatility is low historical volatility.</p>
<p><em>Vol is cheap; market is complacent</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>By being long 10-year call options, we are taking exposure on the risk-free rate implicit in the option pricing models. If interest rates go up, the value of the options can go up dramatically. (loc 4112)</p>
<p><em>Rho matters more for long-dated options</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Forward-looking assumptions based on backward-looking statistical correlations are another source of some interesting opportunities. (loc 4137)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One of our strategies is called cheap sigma and is predicated on the idea that markets sometimes trend and that volatility will dramatically understate the potential price move of markets that trend. (loc 4213)</p>
<p><em>I don’t really understand this argument because practitioners often measure volatility as the root-mean-square of log returns rather than the std (i.e not subtacting the mean) – so trend shows up as a high vol.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If the three-month implied volatility says that the price move that has just occurred was a three and a half standard deviation event, we are going to like the odds of buying deep out-of-the-money options for a price move back in the opposite direction. (loc 4219)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the reason is that the longer the time period, the greater the potential for a trend, and hence the greater the chance that a longer-term price move will exceed the standard deviation implied probability, which increases only by the square root of time. (loc 4231)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In a pool of mortgages, there was at least some reason to assume there would be limited correlation between individual mortgages.</p>
<p>In contrast, all the individual elements of the CDOs were clones—they all represented the lowest tier of a pool of subprime mortgages. If economic conditions were sufficiently unfavorable for the BBB tranche of one mortgage bond pool to be wiped out, the odds were very high that BBB tranches in other pools would also be wiped out, (loc 4287)</p>
<p><em>As is often the case (see e.g LTCM in</em> <em><a href="/?books=when-genius-failed" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">When Genius Failed</a></em> <em>), the mistake that caused the blowup is a bit more subtle than what later gets joked about.</em></p>

<p>You have to remember that the buyers of the CDOs were not the most sophisticated investors. People are hesitant to use the “F” word [fraud], but extreme naïveté would be the only other explanation, if you could believe that’s plausible. We saw a research report by Lehman on a CDO issued at a yield of 70 basis points. We called the secondary desk at Lehman and asked if we could buy protection on that CDO at 70 basis points. They laughed at us. We asked whether we could buy protection at 300 basis points. They said they couldn’t offer that to us, either. So we asked, “How could you issue a CDO at 70 basis points that you are unwilling to assume the risk on at 300?” (loc 4363)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quite simply, one of the best sci-fi books of all time]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PKD is a genius but not always a good writer. Many PKD novels contain truly fantastic ideas, imperfectly executed. Part of this is his style. He throws you headfirst into a weird reality with little exposition; you are expected to pick it up as you go (as with the Nadsat slang in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> ). But I also think that the sheer creativity of the ideas makes it fundamentally difficult for the telling of the ideas to live up to the ideas’ potential – HP Lovecraft explained thus in his refusal to write the <em>Necronomicon</em>: ”If anyone were to try to write the Necronomicon, it would disappoint all those who have shuddered at cryptic references to it”.</p>
<p><em>The Man in the High Castle</em> is a good example of where PKD can go wrong. An incredibly fascinating premise: an alternate history wherein the Axis powers won WW2, with a core plot them being a banned novel in which the <em>Allies</em> won WW2. But the book is strange, wandering, and hard to follow.</p>
<p><em>Ubik</em> , however, is perfection. It ties together PKD’s vibrant creativity and dystopian leanings into a well-written package full of slapstick humour, complex characters (though my bar is low in scifi), and deeply unnerving ideas about the nature of reality. It took a re-read for me to appreciate the subtlety involved in the buildup, and the twists were as delightful as they were the first time. <em>Ubik</em> remains one of my favourite novels.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correlation is evidence of causation (T&Cs apply)]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If correlation is not causation, then what is causation? <em>The Book of Why</em> seeks to answer this question. Causality is quite a strange concept – it is often something that is intuitive to humans, yet something we force ourselves to &quot;unlearn&quot;. The reluctance of scientists to state that a relation is causal is perhaps an overcompensation to avoid our primate tendencies to ascribe causes to everything.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the modern correlation-based approach to statistics has become the default only because it was championed by some very strong personalities in the early 19th century – the &quot;UCL Eugenics Gang&quot; (my phrase) consisting of Ronald Fisher, Karl Pearson et al, who were staunchly opposed to causal methods.</p>
<p>Pearl believes that this groupthink has led to a very poor understanding of causality. Even if we use randomised control trials (the gold standard of causal experimentation), how do we decide which variables to &quot;hold constant&quot;? You have to be very careful here, because holding a variable constant can actually cause two formerly-independent variables to have dependence (Berkson’s paradox). Pearl&#39;s example is as follows: an person&#39;s acting ability and looks should be unrelated. But if I tell you that the person is a celebrity (i.e &quot;hold constant&quot; their celebrity status), there is now some relation between acting ability and attractiveness: if they are unattractive, they are more likely to be a good actor (else there would be no reason for them to be a celebrity).</p>
<p>Pearl mentions several other funky statistical paradoxes, for example, Simpson’s paradox: a drug may be seen to INCREASE the risk of disease in men, INCREASE the risk of disease in women, but DECREASE the risk of disease to the population as a whole. You don&#39;t need causal techniques to resolve problems like these, but they help. What is very impressive is the degree to which Pearl and his students have &quot;algorithmised&quot; these causal problems – if you provide a causal network, there exist algorithms to tell you exactly which variables you should/shouldn&#39;t control if you want to demonstrate causality.</p>
<p>I have two main criticisms of the book. Firstly, it assumes you already have a causal model, then discusses tools to validate it. I wish there was a little bit more about causal discovery (how to discover causal relationships in big systems), and related to that, about causal AI – there is a chapter at the end but it is quite unsatisfactory. Secondly, I would like to see a more self-critical take on causal inference – when does classical statistics work? As it stands, Pearl sometimes sounds like NNT: he thinks his discovery is being criminally ignored by all the surrounding sheeple. There may be a reason for that? It would be amazing if books like this were accompanied by an afterword from a practising statistician who could intelligibly respond to the arguments – I would have much more respect for an author who sought out this kind of criticism!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;d highly recommend this book for people who need to design experiments (e.g pharmaceuticals), or feel disillusioned with correlation-based statistics. It is not at all an easy book to get through (long chapters, semi-technical content), but if you are willing to put in the effort, it could be a brand new paradigm.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The science of causality has made rapid progress recently.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Grand objective is to understand the causal structure</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><strong>Causal Ladder</strong>: Observation → Experimentation → Counterfactuals</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">In the real world (particularly in finance), correlations are all that matter. But causality is what can &quot;guarantee&quot; that the correlations will hold.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical points</h3>

<p>Despite heroic efforts by the geneticist Sewall Wright (1889–1988), causal vocabulary was virtually prohibited for more than half a century. (loc 139)</p>

<p>in many cases we can emulate human retrospective thinking with an algorithm that takes what we know about the observed world and produces an answer about the counterfactual world. This “algorithmization of counterfactuals” is another gem uncovered by the Causal Revolution. (loc 212)</p>

<p>The inference engine is a machine that accepts three different kinds of inputs—Assumptions, Queries, and Data—and produces three kinds of outputs. The first of the outputs is a Yes/No decision as to whether the given query can in theory be answered under the existing causal model, assuming perfect and unlimited data. If the answer is Yes, the inference engine next produces an Estimand. This is a mathematical formula that can be thought of as a recipe for generating the answer from any hypothetical data, whenever they are available. Finally, after the inference engine has received the Data input, it will use the recipe to produce an actual Estimate for the answer, along with statistical estimates of the amount of uncertainty in that estimate. (loc 243)</p>

<p>some queries may not be answerable under the current causal model, even after the collection of any amount of data. For example, if our model shows that both D and L depend on a third variable Z (say, the stage of a disease), and if we do not have any way to measure Z, then the query P(L | do(D)) cannot be answered.

<p>The back-door criterion tells us which sets of variables we can use to deconfound our data. The adjustment formula actually does the deconfounding. In the simplest case of linear regression, partial regression coefficients perform the back-door adjustment implicitly. (loc 3396)</p>

<p>front-door adjustment is such a powerful tool: it allows us to control for confounders that we cannot observe (like Motivation), including those that we can’t even name. RCTs are considered the “gold standard” of causal effect estimation for exactly the same reason. (loc 3517)</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=a-man-for-all-markets"/>
        <updated>2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In many ways, Thorp’s biography reminds me of <em>Surely You&#39;re Joking, Mr Feynman</em> – it is the autobiography of a curious and extremely intelligent person who found success in the many areas he looked at. Thorp’s initial claim to fame was devising a system for gaining edge in Blackjack by counting cards (subsequently authoring <em>Beat the Dealer</em> ), and even more impressively, actually using this system to make money.</p>
<p>He later turned his prodigious intellect towards the markets, deriving the Black-Scholes formula for pricing warrants several years before Black and Scholes did (and making a boatload of money in the process).</p>
<p>In my view, Thorp’s greatest strength was his unique ability to apply advanced mathematics to the real world. There are probably better financial mathematicians out there (perhaps even people like Merton and Scholes), but few had the meta-rationality to understand when to trade-off rigour for practicality, nor the courage to go out there and do it!</p>
<p>As an autobiography, it is a little bit unfocused and I think a general reader might feel that it goes into too much detail on some of the technical aspects (though I enjoyed this!). I’ll leave it to Thorp to summarise his own philosophy:</p>
<hr>
<p>When you reincarnate as practitioner, you want the mountain to give birth to the simplest possible strategy, and one that has the smallest number of side effects, the minimum possible hidden complications.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I viewed everyone I met as my equal, due the same respect I wanted, unless their behavior showed me otherwise.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut were at a party given by a billionaire when Vonnegut asked Heller how it felt to know that their host might have made more money in one day than Heller’s Catch-22 since it was written. Heller said he had something the rich man could never have. When a puzzled Vonnegut asked what that could be, Heller answered, “The knowledge that I’ve got enough.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Lesson: It doesn’t pay to push the other party to their absolute limit. A small extra gain is generally not worth the substantial risk the deal will break up.</p>
<p><em>Again, meta-rationality.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I don’t object to some people being richer, even much richer, than others. I object to gain of wealth through political connections rather than earning it by merit. If a basketball franchise pays my neighbor Kobe Bryant $20 million a year because it takes that much to get him, fine. But if hedge fund managers bribe politicians to put a clause in the laws cutting the tax rate on much of their income to a fraction of the percentage the average worker pays, I object.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Whatever you do, enjoy your life and the people who share it with you, and leave something good of yourself for the generations to follow.</p>
<p>...</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anything can be measured]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While analysing digital entertainment companies over my summer internship in long/short equity, I got stuck on the question of how to value a company&#39;s intellectual property. How can one quantitatively estimate the value of something so intangible? I proceeded with a thought experiment – suppose there were two companies, the only difference being IP. How would that affect the two businesses? I was able to come up with some rough estimate: if you own IP, the next time you want to produce a movie, you get to keep all of the profits rather than having to pay a portion to a licensor; this difference can be thought of as the cash flow profile of the IP.</p>
<p><em>How to Measure Anything</em> is a definitive resource on questions of this nature. The key thesis of <em>HTMA</em> , as suggested in the title, is that any quantity of practical interest can be measured – where &quot;measurement&quot; is defined as a reduction in uncertainty. Hubbard provides several techniques and examples of how this might be done in practice.</p>
<p><em>HTMA</em> is a difficult book to review; it has too many case studies and anecdotes for it to be a textbook, but goes into far more detail than a typical nonfiction book would. For example, rather than simply stating that Bayes theorem is the appropriate framework for thinking about many measurement problems, Hubbard actually provides step-by-step walk throughs of the calculations (referencing some excel workbooks).</p>
<p>I think <em>HTMA</em> is an excellent book for the right audience – I would broadly characterise this audience as practitioners/students of &quot;management science&quot;: managers who are facing difficult business questions that look unquantifiable, or mathematicians/physicists who want to learn about business. Though for people more interested in rationality and decision making, I would suggest starting with <a href="/?books=superforecasting" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Superforecasting</a> instead (many of the concepts are similar). <em>HTMA</em> still has plenty of value, but it is easy to get bogged down by the walkthroughs of the actual calculations (I would have preferred it relegated to the appendix, but I&#39;m not the target audience).</p>
<p>The short case studies at the end might be an interesting place to start – if you are as impressed with them as I was, you can dig into the rest of the book for the nuts and bolts.</p>

<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Everything of practical importance is measurable, else it could not be practical by definition.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Uncertainty-reduction has diminishing returns. When you are very uncertain about something, even a tiny amount of data can massively reduce uncertainty, but to get high levels of precision, you need a lot of data.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Correlation does not imply causation, but it does provide evidence for causation (via Bayes theorem).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">It is worth thinking about the meta-question: determining the value of knowing an answer to the question, rather than just valuing the answer to the question. This can tell you how much time/money you should allocate to finding an answer.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Applied Information Economics is a rational framework for approaching business cases: focus on the areas that are most uncertain and consider the value of measurements before designing a quantitative strategy for uncertainty reduction.</li>

<p>the question is never whether a decision can be modeled or even whether it can be modeled quantitatively. We are modeling it even if we rely on intuition and anything that can be modeled intuitively can be represented in a quantitative model that at least avoids some of the errors of intuition.

<p>Georg Rasch developed a solution to this problem. He proposed a method for predicting the chance that a subject would correctly answer a true/false question based on (1) the percentage of other subjects in the population who answered that particular item correctly and (2) the percentage of other questions that the subject answered correctly. Even if test subjects were taking different tests, the performance on a test by a subject who never took it could be predicted with a computable error. (loc 6519)</p>

<p>Rasch and Bayes can give different answers so there is a choice to be made between them. Bayes is more mathematically well-founded and I would use it exclusively only if Rasch lacked empirical evidence of working. But since Rasch has evidence of working and since it seems easy to apply in certain problems, it should be considered a solution if the Bayesian model gets too complex. (loc 6548)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack of all trades is oftentimes better than a master of one]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Range</em> argues that society places excess emphasis on specialisation: we hear &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; as a criticism, but forget that the complete saying ends with &quot;oftentimes better than a master of one&quot;.</p>
<p>I should warn that this review is prone to confirmation bias: before reading the book I was a strong believer in breadth over depth. Perhaps this is partially due to a disenchantment with the narrowly focussed UK higher education system, but equally responsible is my observation that any interesting insights I may have had consistently arose not from a deep understanding of a particular subject, but rather from a decent knowledge of disparate fields. I am reasonably confident that any career edge I have will not come from knowing my subject the best, but from looking at old ideas in new ways or recognising that a concept from one discipline could be applied elsewhere.</p>
<p>The book itself is rather unfocussed, which made it a difficult read at times, but it feels wrong for me to levy a criticism based on the lack of focus given that the whole thesis of the book is the importance of breadth. Epstein makes his case by drawing on a diverse set of examples, citing sportsmen (Roger Federer), Nobel laureates (Andre Geim, of graphene fame), musicians, inventors and CEOs. Epstein notes that breadth is important in different ways depending on the domain; it increases creativity for musicians and academics, accuracy for forecasters, and empathy for business leaders.</p>
<p>It is easy to draw the wrong message from the book – that specialisation isn&#39;t needed. All of the case studies involve people who have an outstanding ability in their field, but recognise the point of diminishing returns and allocate their time more wisely to other pursuits. In fact, Epstein highlights some areas in which specialisation is indeed superior to breadth – for &quot;closed&quot; systems with limited epistemic uncertainty, specialised training is the best pathway to success. Examples of these systems include chess, surgery, firefighting, poker, golf. However, specialisation is not optimal in systems where you need to constantly create new mental models – in fact, domain knowledge can make people <em>worse off</em> because they are not able to put down their familiar tools and actually think.</p>
<p>There are several actionable takeaways from the book.</p>
<p>Firstly, the importance of reading beyond your subject. Wide reading makes you more intellectually creative in general, but also makes you better at your subject as you discover new connections. This ties in well with the whole second brain philosophy of <a href="/?books=how-to-take-smart-notes" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">How to Take Smart Notes</a>. Secondly, it is okay to switch paths (be that academically or in your career). Such exploration is a natural part of optimisation (see <a href="/?books=algorithms-to-live-by" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Algorithms to Live By</a> for a discussion of the explore vs exploit tradeoff). For example, Epstein argues that the classical notion of &quot;foolish youngsters&quot; seeking careers in acting or music in the hope of becoming A-list celebrities actually contains some wisdom: in a system with deep epistemic uncertainty (the &quot;unknown unknown&quot;), i&#39;s smart to look for convex bets that have high learning value, even if the probability of success is low. Thirdly, as is almost cliche to say, failure is a learning experience (discussed in much more detail by <a href="/?books=black-box-thinking" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Black Box Thinking</a>).</p>
<p>Related to this, <em>Range</em> contains some surprising positivity in regards to comparing oneself with others:</p>
<p>Like Caesar, many of the successful people discussed in the book were late bloomers; Epstein goes so far as to argue that their success is in no small part due to the range of experiences they had, which may have looked like aimless meandering at the time. With social media constantly peppering you with examples of how other people are experiencing or accomplishing amazing things, it&#39;s nice to have the reassurance that, in the words of Billy Joel, &quot;you can afford to lose a day or two. When will you realize... Vienna waits for you?&quot;</p>

<p>The expression “young and foolish,” he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. It is ideal.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had previously dismissed <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> as prime example of the “trashy action” genre that I seek to avoid, but a friend raised the valid criticism that I hadn&#39;t actually read the book, so was &quot;judging it by its cover&quot;. To that end, I did my best to set aside my preconceived notions and started reading the book.</p>
<p>The book is something of a page-turner, in the same way that an incomplete sentence makes you turn to the next page. There is little attempt to build genuine suspense and mystery, in favour of an &quot;everyone is in on it&quot;-style conspiracy with cheap twists (which are unexpected only because they are completely illogical).</p>
<p>That said, the novel merits two stars rather than one because the history and symbology (whatever portions of them are not made up) are actually quite interesting; they are just presented in a terrible package.</p>
<p>I know this review reeks of intellectual elitism. I am not categorically opposed to books like this: if they encourage people to read, or people find them entertaining, then all the better for it. But for anyone willing to put in a bit more effort to engage with what they are reading, there are plenty of alternatives – for instance, <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> is a great example of a suspenseful adventure novel that is full of twists and surprises without being silly.</p>

<p>&quot;This is very common in times of turmoil,&quot; Langdon continued. &quot;A newly emerging power will take over the existing symbols and degrade them over time in an attempt to erase their meaning. In the battle between the pagan symbols and Christian symbols, the pagans lost; Poseidon&#39;s trident became the devil&#39;s pitchfork, the wise crone&#39;s pointed hat became the symbol of a witch, and Venus&#39;s pentacle became a sign of the devil.&quot; (loc 589)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capitalism requires competition, but tends to destroy competition]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An incredibly important book which highlights everything that I hate about capitalism. As with communism, the theoretical merits of capitalism are often blunted by poor implementation. What I admire about capitalism as a philosophy is that it is one of the few systems that has demonstrably been able to foster cooperation between fundamentally selfish individuals. The great irony is that success in the capitalist system sows the seeds for the destruction of the very same system, as large companies stifle competition in order to increase their own profits at the literal expense of the consumer. Tepper provides numerous examples of the monopolies and oligopolies that run the world – both the obvious ones, like Google search, as well as the hidden ones, like how EssilorLuxotica dominates the market for spectacles and sunglasses.</p>
<p>Perhaps where my view differs from that of the authors is the question of who is at fault. Tepper&#39;s anger is distributed across all the members of the system, but I tend to believe that it is the regulators, not market participants, who must bear the lion&#39;s share of the blame. A capitalist is behaving perfectly rational when they seek to become a monopolist, as are investors who choose to allocate capital to those companies with the widest competitive moat. It is the role of the government to draw the line between selfish gains and direct harm to others; their consistent failure to do so is no fault of the investors (or even the companies – though this is definitely a more controversial view). &quot;Don&#39;t hate the player, hate the game&quot;.</p>
<p>This book has cemented my view that the current implementation of capitalism in America (and to a lesser extent elsewhere) is broken. Corporate lobbying is a ridiculous system that provides a legal means by which companies can bribe politicians for concessions that cost the consumer. One of the most heinous examples (not in this book, but nicely covered in Michael Lewis&#39; <a href="/?books=the-fifth-risk" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Fifth Risk</a>) is the story of AccuWeather, a service that takes weather data freely published by the US government and wraps it into a program which it sells to weather apps and news media. AccuWeather has subsequently lobbied to make it incredibly difficult for other participants to access this free source directly. I found the discussion of the role of governments to be very insightful:</p>
<p><em>The Myth of Capitalism</em> is well-argued and as apolitical as it could be – efficient capitalism should be a bipartisan concern.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Importance of competition</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Capitalism without competition is not capitalism.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Left attacks the grotesque capitalism we see today, as if that were the true manifestation of the essence of capitalism rather than the distorted version it has become.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Competition matters because it prevents unjust inequality, rather than the transfer of wealth from consumer or supplier to the monopolist. If there is no competition, consumers and workers have less freedom to choose. Competition creates clear price signals in markets, driving supply and demand. It promotes efficiency. Competition creates more choices, more innovation, economic development and growth, and a stronger democracy by dispersing economic power. It promotes individual initiative and freedom. Competition is the essence of capitalism, yet it is dying.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Competition is the basis for evolution. An absence of competition means an absence of evolution, a failure to adapt to new conditions. It threatens our survival.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>companies in highly concentrated industries spent less on R&amp;D. They found that “the total number of innovations is inversely correlated with concentrationand that monopoly power deters innovation. They concluded, “Innovation falls as industrial concentration increases.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Economic freedom is an essential requisite for political freedom. By enabling people to cooperate with one another without coercion or central direction, it reduces the area over which political power is exercised.” The principal reason for supporting free markets was not lower prices or consumer welfare, but strengthening of democracy and freedom. “In addition, by dispersing power, the free market provides an offset to whatever concentration of political power may arise. The combination of economic and political power in the same hands is a sure recipe for tyranny.” It is the great irony of history that Friedman&#39;s disciples have done so much to concentrate power. They have achieved a private tyranny.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In a competitive market, if a company is making a lot of money, other companies will get excited by the prospects of high profits and will enter the industry and compete. Eventually margins decline as more competitors fight each other. Something is profoundly broken with capitalism if corporate profit margins do not revert to the historical mean.</p>

<p>The Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek was a believer in free markets and railed against concentrations of power. He believed that inevitably once economic power was consolidated, the monopolies and cartels would become “governmental instrumentalities to achieve political ends.” Ordoliberalism argued that capitalism requires a strong government to create a framework of rules that provide the order (ordo in Latin) that free markets need to function properly.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>while big businesses often complain about regulation, the truth is that even though it is painful and annoying, they don&#39;t mind it and even favor it. Regulations that are burdensome enough to kill small companies but are not strong enough to kill large ones are, in fact, ideal.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Reagan Department of Justice radically changed how we deal with monopolies. By only looking at the price of goods, to the exclusion of all other considerations, the government created a system that any company could game. As long as you promised a merger would keep prices low, you had a blank check to merge.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One thing that can make a monopoly permanent is government, because only government can prevent the sort of innovation and competition that undermines every corporate giant.</p>

<p>The ECB bought corporate debt, directly financing mergers and acquisitions for billionaire shareholders. They financed the merger that allowed the billionaire owners of AB Inbev to merge the company with SAB, which gave them control over 50% of the US beer market.</p>

<p>Like all revolutions, an organized group of ideologues developed the ideas and spread them zealously. The Chicago School, led by Milton Friedman and George Stigler, was the vanguard of attack against antitrust laws. The great irony is that they decried monopolies and concentration of power, but in practice they created all the conditions necessary for them.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For the Chicago School, if it looks like a monopoly, walks like a monopoly and quacks like a monopoly, it is probably just your imagination.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Firms use economists for hire to create models “proving” that mergers will lower prices. But once mergers go through, prices mysteriously go up. These remind us of New Year&#39;s resolutions to lose weight.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Collusion </strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>There is nothing new under the sun. Even in the eighteenth century, Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Some economists sincerely believe that cartels and collusion are impossible. In particular, the ultra-free-market Chicago School of economics argued that cartels and collusion were almost impossible because it is difficult to coordinate competitors, competitors would be prone to cheat, and new entrants would come in to compete with the cartel. All of these ideas, however, were not based on any evidence and were simply conjured out of thin air by theory.</p>
<p><em>A Chicago Classic – see the Efficient Markets Hypothesis</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Levenstein and Suslow made the unusual discovery that the most important factor in the creation and breakups of cartels was the interest rate. Cartels are more likely to break up during periods of high real interest rates, presumably because higher interest rates require higher immediate rates of return for collusion. They found the relationship was almost perfect, and observed that creating and sustaining cartels required patience. The higher the interest rates, the less likely cartels would be sustained, and the lower the real rates, the more likely cartels would cooperate and keep playing their games.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>You don&#39;t need players to talk to each other to get collusion. Game theory has shown that firms are able to reach what look like cooperative outcomes on the basis of genuinely independent decisions.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Because of antitrust laws, companies didn&#39;t try to corner over 90% of any market, lest they be broken up like Standard Oil. Instead, they went for what has been called “merger for oligopoly” rather than outright monopoly. Industries organized themselves into a few leaders per industry that could tacitly collude, rather than one overall monopolist.</p>

<p>Within a year of joining Shockley, the new hires sat around a breakfast table at the Clift Hotel to plot their escape. Although they were America&#39;s most brilliant scientists and engineers, they were distinctly unhappy working for Shockley.

Later dubbed the “Traitorous Eight,” they signed dollar bills in place of formal contracts – a symbol of nonconformity.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The greatest gift one can get from a book is not new knowledge, but a new way of thinking. That’s exactly what <em>Thinking in Systems</em> aims to do. It is an accessible introduction to the field of systems dynamics, the study of how the interaction between individual units (be they cells, people, production lines) can lead to complex behaviour:</p>
<p>The chapter on systems traps was particularly fascinating - there are common problems that occur in completely different systems by virtue of the system structure (rather than the actions of certain units within the system). The very existence of these systems traps means that we as a society must be exceedingly careful in how we allocate blame – too often, an individual or group is blamed for what is really a flaw in the system. On paper, the objective of systems dynamicists is somewhat grandiose (particularly the suggestions of using systems to understand human emotions), but Meadows shows a deep intellectual humility, recognising that great care is needed in both system design and system analysis.</p>
<p><em>Thinking in Systems</em> is a must-read, for it contains the potential to help you understand the world on a more meta level – developing an appreciation for the systems that underpin the seemingly ineffable dynamics of the society, the environment, the economy – and the meta-meta-epistemological level of how we might reason about these systems.</p>

<p>The human mind seems to focus more easily on stocks than on flows. On top of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on inflows more easily than on outflows. Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate. (loc 427)</p>

<p>Here is a new balancing feedback loop that ultimately will control the growth of capital: the more capital, the higher the extraction rate. The higher the extraction rate, the lower the resource stock. The lower the resource stock, the lower the yield of resource per unit of capital, so the lower the profit (with price assumed constant) and the lower the investment rate—therefore, the lower the rate of growth of capital.

<p>THE TRAP: ESCALATION When the state of one stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock—and vice versa—then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, escalating loudness, escalating violence. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by someone’s collapse—because exponential growth cannot go on forever. THE WAY OUT The best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in it. If caught in an escalating system, one can refuse to compete (unilaterally disarm), thereby interrupting the reinforcing loop. Or one can negotiate a new system with balancing loops to control the escalation. (loc 1961)</p>

<p>Rule beating is usually a response of the lower levels in a hierarchy to overrigid, deleterious, unworkable, or ill-defined rules from above. There are two generic responses to rule beating. One is to try to stamp out the self-organizing response by strengthening the rules or their enforcement—usually giving rise to still greater system distortion. That’s the way further into the trap. The way out of the trap, the opportunity, is to understand rule beating as useful feedback, and to revise, improve, rescind, or better explain the rules. (loc 2147)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ray Dalio&#39;s <em>How The Economic Machine Works</em> is a good introduction to macroeconomics, focusing on the importance of two key variables: interest rates and inflation. When the economy is slowing down, the Central Bank can cut rates, stimulating spending and investment, which in theory leads to inflation. As the economy heats up, the Central Bank can normalise things by raising rates, which holds down inflation.</p>
<p>In principle, this is all there is to it. But reality is much more complex because all market participants are aware of the above and seek to position themselves accordingly. Moreover, the Central Bank is aware that market participants know about it, and (some) market participants know that the Central Bank is aware that market participants know about it, and the Central bank knows that market participants know that...</p>
<p>A bluff is truly an apt description for the situation – the Central Bank is now playing a self-reinforcing game of expectations (indeed, many bond traders are avid poker players). The trouble is that these expectation games, or Keynesian beauty contests, are much harder to orchestrate because there is no guarantee that the Central Bank action has its intended effect if market participants don&#39;t believe that the Central Bank will follow up. If people keep bluffing at the table, you start calling them down with ace-high.</p>
<p>Part I of <em>Bluff</em> gives an excellent brief history of money, explaining the troubled relationship society has had with sound money (backed by physical gold) and providing a lot of context for what&#39;s been happening in the past two decades.</p>
<p>Part II discusses the intricacies of reflexivity and why Central Bank action has turned into a fragile game of mass psychology. Part III applies these concepts in explaining how the game created (or at the very least exacerbated) recent financial crises – chapter 11 does a fantastic job of explaining why quantitative easing didn&#39;t work as intended: incentives are skewed in favour of capital investment rather than real investment, leading to asset price inflation without real inflation, which benefits the top 1% but not so much the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Part IV and V form a provocative discussion about the future of Central Banking, which is particularly relevant in the context of a possible COVID-induced recession. I can&#39;t claim that I understand the majority of the book; it is one that I will be revisiting in future whenever I find myself unsure about Central Bank policy.</p>

<p>The game the central banks play in running the economy is predicated on a bluff: that by lowering interest rates they can propel the public into economic activity that leads to greater prosperity characterised by more jobs and wages.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For cheap money to spur growth, people must overcome their doubt and trust in one another’s ability and willingness to earn and spend money. It is because of this doubt and mistrust that lowering interest rates does not suffice in itself as a strategy for growth. It is the reason why central banks must display a confidence – a certain swagger – backed up, if need be, by coercive tactics to demonstrate that they can compel the public to spend.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Their [central bankers’] decisions have gone unquestioned mostly because of the indispensability of their role, rather than our conviction of its correctness.</p>

<p>Like the boy who cried wolf once too often, the central banks may discover how a jaded and sceptical public does not fall for their bluff, rendering them powerless as the markets spiral out of control.</p>

<p>Inflicting negative real interest rates in the name of growth is just as counterproductive as war in the name of peace. It is degradation posing as liberty – an inherent contradiction that scuppers any belief that we can get wealthy by cheating the public of its purchasing power.</p>

<p>To err in one’s decision-making was something that appeared to affect the people who engaged in trading and investing – but somehow not the men and women who set the price of money to pump up asset values.</p>

<p><em>On asset bubbles</em></p>
<p>There is a notion that because assets act as conduits of the intergenerational transfer of wealth, they allow older generations to consume more by selling their overpriced, potentially worthless assets to the young. The existence of overvalued assets or bubbles therefore rectifies the problem of too much saving by the young by in effect getting them to fund greater consumption by the old by overpaying for assets held by them. Bursting a bubble, then, means depriving the old of greater consumption in favour of too much saving, even if it is more productively utilised. The conclusion that logically follows is that if an asset bubble bursts of its own accord, policy makers should then create another one.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>How central banks became so important </strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>In the absence of a central bank acting as lender of last resort [1792 economic downturn], it was evident that it fell upon the State to restore mercantile confidence for the benefit of the tax-paying public, and doing so indeed made for a win-win situation.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The Bank of England’s responsibility at the helm of the international Gold Standard required a deft touch, albeit a different deftness than that required today. Its task was to adhere to a mechanism rather than to target a variety of economic variables, as today’s central bankers are expected to do.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Monetary financing of government expenditure amounted to the effective suspension of the Gold Standard, even though it was not officially suspended in Britain until after the First World War in April 1919.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the price volatility of the post-war years in Britain created a yearning for the economic stability of the Gold Standard era. Consequently, Britain restored the Gold Standard in 1925, although, as would become evident later, the price of gold was set too high. An overvalued pound meant it was cheaper to buy foreign goods and the demand for British goods fell, causing an outflow of gold. The economy contracted at the same time and unemployment rose.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The lesson they took away from the turbulent years of the Great Depression was to err forever on the side of keeping interest rates low rather than be found guilty of inaction. Ironically, this thinking would eventually cause these central banks to replicate the collapse, rather than avoid it.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The economic ideology of the post-war years saw a dramatic shift. Inflation was no longer seen as an unmitigated curse. Rather it was viewed as the ‘cost’ of mass employment. Prevailing theory argued that there existed a trade-off between unemployment and inflation; more inflation meant less unemployment. As alleviating the economic suffering of the public was considered more important than preserving the sanctity of the currency, inflation became permissible so long as it was kept in relative check.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>And so it happened. Born of a quid pro quo between a government and shareholders and the exigencies of banking panics, the central banks had shed their mortal skins and by the 1990s emerged as the three-headed Supreme Beings they are today – Controllers of Inflation, Overseers of the Financial Industry and Creators of Economic Fortunes.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>The lower the confidence in a future income stream, the weaker is the power of a lower cost of credit to encourage spending and investment.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The central bank can drop the interest rate all the way down to almost zero, or even make it negative. But for it to affect your behaviour you must believe that there is the potential for a strong income stream to begin with. As soon as your confidence in that potential income stream starts to wane, the central bank starts to lose its ability to defeat economic recessions.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The key, however, to the central banks’ seemingly limitless power lies in making us believe that printing money and cheap debt are the means to everlasting prosperity.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Inflation</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The conclusion therefore was that central banks should rely on consumer price inflation to alert them to any exaggerated moves in the equity or real estate markets. ‘By focusing on the inflationary and deflationary pressures generated by asset price movements, a central bank effectively responds to the toxic side of booms and busts without getting into the business of deciding what is a fundamental move and what is not’,2 explained Bernanke and Gertler. Crucially, this approach would absolve the central bankers of making a value judgement as to whether equity and real estate markets were in the throes of speculation or led by economic growth. Instead, it would put in place the rule of inflation to act as rudder.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>From the low in October 1998 to mid-July 1999, the US S&amp;P 500 index surged by a little over 50 per cent, while the FTSE all-share index (comprising FTSE 350 and small cap indices) rose by over 40 per cent. In both cases, the increases were well ahead of the losses earlier in the summer of 1998 in the wake of the Russian debt default, in what was already a very ebullient stock market. All this time, unemployment continued to decline in both countries, yet inflation remained low. This was when the game started to go awry. In the period that followed, wages would at best grow at mid-single digits while real estate and equity markets took turns in posting no less than double-digit gains, putting asset and consumer prices on different trajectories.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The central banks therefore are left in a fix: they can knowingly let a bubble grow unsustainably bigger, in the vain hope that wages will catch up in the nick of time. Or they can raise rates in an attempt to restrain the very investor they had egged on, but in the process expose the shaky foundation of the growth they had engineered, thereby risking exactly the deflationary bust they had attempted to prevent. So either way, their low interest rate prescription laced with its inflation aftertaste increases the chances of an eventual deflationary bust. That is the inflation paradox.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>The Pavlovian drop in the extra return that investors and lenders demanded for riskier investments each time base rates were cut was something that the central banks had grown accustomed to in controlling asset prices and running the economy with the interest rate lever. Post-crisis, trusting investors and lenders were understandably reluctant to fall for the bluff yet again.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>there is no doubt that ultimately time will prove that the game of bluff of pumping assets pre-emptively to boost economic growth in the short run is not really worth playing at all.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One arrives therefore at the absurd situation wherein there are further unintended consequences that result from the redistributive policies to rectify the first set of unintended consequences. Ironically, politicians rationalise redistributive policy measures with the notion that they are somehow making up for the failure of capitalist enterprise to create a more egalitarian society. In fact, the exacerbation of inequality is caused by the central bank in its proactive attempt to micro-manage the natural ebb and flow of economic activity and interfere in the signals contained in market-driven prices (the price of money, i.e. the cost of borrowing in this case) that allow for efficient allocation of savings.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For all the bombastic breadth of the Dodd-Frank Act, it is what those who conceived it missed that will eventually prove that it did little to truly overhaul the system. They missed the nature of a financial panic, confused correlation with causality and tried to fix the problem by addressing the symptoms one by one, when the inherent cause lay untrammelled.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Why was it, then, that the price of gold was overcompensating so dramatically, just as it had in the 1970s, when all measures of consumer prices had been rising at double-digit rates? The simplest answer is that the dollar price of gold was reflective of the dichotomy of asset and consumer prices and was adjusting to capture the full inflationary impetus that was funnelling into the former, as opposed to simply reflecting money that was chasing consumer goods and services.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the central banks’ actions – well-intentioned as they might be – are a major threat to the economy. By their very nature, systemic risks arise in response to monetary policy.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To those who say ‘inflation, what inflation?’ – know that you fool only yourselves. As those who could protect themselves from the surfeit of paper money rushed for capital assets, the payoffs of which adjust higher to account for inflation.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We can think of the quantity and quality of credit created in an economy as being subject to the same trade-off. The more certain we are about the quantity of credit that is created by lowering interest rates, the less certain we can be of its quality (as defined by the probability of default by the borrower).</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Bankers are, however, expected to circumvent the all-powerful signal of prices that is engineered by the central banks and exercise a very strong value judgement about who to extend credit to, in the pretence that in so doing, they can alter the increased uncertainty inherent in greater risk-taking.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>Taxing symbols of wealth punishes human diligence and ingenuity that honestly earns its way to wealth, while encouraging governments to create an ever larger surfeit of paper money that they can then tax surreptitiously.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Hence, for inflation targeting to work as a concept, there must be a genuine commitment to preserving the purchasing power of money. Central banks should therefore target a general price level that will be the same in 2015 as it will be in 2115, just as it was through much of the 100 years preceding the First World War.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Such a policy would remove people’s panic that they might lose their savings to eroding purchasing power, which is the main incentive for them to chase capital assets, and the reason that unsustainable asset price bubbles develop in the first place. It would greatly lessen the debt that people take on to buy property as an insurance against a surfeit of paper money in the economy. And it would encourage the creation of credit that had a reasonable chance of producing a strong enough income stream – one that paid for itself, even at higher interest rates. Risk-taking would be steered more towards the creation of value, all but insensitive to the central banks’ bluff.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Central bankers should therefore, similar to the commercial and investment bank executives, have their performance-linked pay (or any remuneration that is above the average salary for civil servants) or pensions clawed back if a regulated financial institution later collapses due to insufficient collateral and lack of liquidity. This would go some way towards protecting taxpayers from regulatory and policy errors by the central bankers.</p>
<p><em>Massive problem with regulatory capture</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>it does seem absurd that an agent of the government (the central bank) should try to boost aggregate spending by cutting interest rates, when the government itself – as it is in the UK – is dampening spending with a value-added tax on consumption of 20 per cent!</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the burden of longer-term economic repercussions is unfairly pinned on commercial and investment bankers, who are merely responding to the price signal of cheaper rates as intended and cannot be held responsible for the greater uncertainty associated with an increase in credit, particularly when it is at a collective level.</p>
<p><em>If you are creating problems by preventing free market action, it is probably not helpful to be penalising what little free market decision-makers remain!</em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Expectations Investing</em> is a fantastic book on a particular style of equity investing – I haven’t found a better (publicly available) description of the philosophy used by Long/Short equity hedge funds.</p>
<p>L/S shops do care about company fundamentals, but only when contextualised with consensus expectations. The key idea (which should be familiar to most of the people reading this) is that to make money, you need to have a non-consensus view of the stock because consensus expectations get priced into the stock. In other words, “everybody uses it” is not in itself a good reason to buy Google stock. The rest of the market already knows that, and accordingly, they reward Google with a higher earnings multiple.</p>
<p>With this in mind, investment success comes from accurately (at least better than random) anticipating expectations revisions. <em>Expectations Investing</em> discusses the importance of this philosophy and describes how it is applied in practice. For example, newcomers are often surprised that L/S hedge funds (who mostly trade quarters) care about the long term financials of a company. The long term fundamentals matter because the stock is priced today based on the fundamentals many years in the future. Most news events don’t impact the company’s current quarter – it is their effect on the long term financials that gets traded.</p>
<p>This leads to a nuanced perspective on valuations. People often treat valuation as a formula for computing the stock price based on your estimates of the fundamentals. Perhaps a better way of thinking about it: valuation lets you convert between expectations and price. This goes both ways – you can use the current price to understand long term expectations, and likewise, if you can anticipate a change in these long term expectations (which may be precipitated by a short term event like company earnings), you can estimate how much the price should move.</p>
<p><em>Expectations Investing</em> isn’t a book for beginners, but it’s an excellent resource for those who have covered the basics and are now looking to understand how hedge funds approach stock picking.</p>

<p>The ability to properly read market expectations and anticipate revisions of these expectations is the springboard for superior returns—long-term returns above an appropriate benchmark.</p>

<p>If a company earns exactly the cost of capital, growth adds no value. Likewise, if returns fall below the cost of capital, then growth destroys value. Growth can be good news, bad news, or no news.</p>

<p>Most investors use accounting-based tools, like short-term earnings and price-earnings multiples. These inherently flawed measures are becoming even less useful as companies increasingly depend on intangible rather than tangible assets to create value.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>a company may use straight-line depreciation for book purposes and an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes. Since accelerated depreciation is greater than straight-line depreciation, it increases a company’s expenses and reduces its cash tax bill. As a result, cash tax rates are typically lower than book tax rates.</p>

<p>Companies sometimes use share buybacks to increase their financial leverage, which investors often construe favorably because it suggests confidence in future cash flows.</p>

<p>When a company would rather return cash to its shareholders than invest in its business, you can infer that the market’s expectations for the company’s value-creating opportunities are too high.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An extraordinarily humble autobiography from someone who has more than earned the right to lather himself with praise; Bob Iger was the visionary CEO of Disney who led the company through the massive acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Fox (I was surprised to learn that they were one phone call away from acquiring Twitter!). My favourite part of the book was the Pixar deal, Iger&#39;s first acquisition after being appointed CEO, recounting how he fixed the relationship between Disney and Steve Jobs, ultimately making a close friend in the process.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on hindsight to justify his decisions post hoc, Iger is candid and reflective with his mistakes and I think there is a lot of wisdom in how he dealt with difficult situations. What stands out is Iger&#39;s deep respect and empathy for other people, which powerfully combined with his eye for strategy, making him an extremely effective CEO.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even though you’re “in charge,” you need to be aware that in the moment you might have nothing to add, and so you don’t wade in. You trust your people to do their jobs and focus your energies on some other pressing issue.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It’s a delicate thing, finding the balance between demanding that your people perform and not instilling a fear of failure in them.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The first rule is not to fake anything. You have to be humble, and you can’t pretend to be someone you’re not or to know something you don’t. You’re also in a position of leadership, though, so you can’t let humility prevent you from leading. It’s a fine line, and something I preach today. You have to ask the questions you need to ask, admit without apology what you don’t understand, and do the work to learn what you need to learn as quickly as you can.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>You can’t wear your disdain for people on your sleeve, though. You end up either cowing them into submission or frustrating them into complacency. Either way, you sap them of the pride they take in their work.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It’s a tricky thing, moving people over to your side and enlisting their enthusiastic engagement. Sometimes it’s worth talking through their reservations and patiently responding to their concerns. Other times you simply need to communicate that you’re the boss and you want this done. It’s not that one approach is “nice” and the other isn’t. It’s just that one is more direct and nonnegotiable. It really comes down to what you believe is right for the moment—when a more democratic approach is useful both in getting to the best outcome and in building morale, and when you have enough certainty in your opinion that you’re willing to be an autocrat even in the face of disagreement.</p>
<p><em>It’s ok for a leader to be autocratic sometimes!</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>True integrity—a sense of knowing who you are and being guided by your own clear sense of right and wrong—is a kind of secret leadership weapon. If you trust your own instincts and treat people with respect, the company will come to represent the values you live by.</p>

<p>Even in the face of difficult choices and less than ideal outcomes, an optimistic leader does not yield to pessimism. Simply put, people are not motivated or energized by pessimists.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>as a leader you can’t communicate that pessimism to the people around you. It’s ruinous to morale. It saps energy and inspiration. Decisions get made from a protective, defensive posture.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I can’t overstate how important it is to keep blows to the ego, real as they often are, from occupying too big a place in your mind and sapping too much of your energy. It’s easy to be optimistic when everyone is telling you you’re great. It’s much harder, and much more necessary, when your sense of yourself is being challenged, and in such a public way.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I even took a moment before I walked into the room to look again at Theodore Roosevelt’s “The Man in the Arena” speech, which has long been an inspiration: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.”</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Porter is often cited in discussions about corporate strategy (particularly his eponymous Five Forces), yet there are a great many misconceptions about his thinking. For example, the Five Forces don’t tell you anything about a company’s competitive position. Instead, they are meant to characterise the competitive structure of an industry – separate analysis of the value chains and value propositions is required to understand the strategies of companies in an industry and the intra-industry competitive landscape.</p>
<p>There are several actionable takeaways from the book, which I believe are relevant to both operators and investors. For example, competitive strategy is about pursuing unique value creation – not being the biggest/best in an industry. Durable competitive advantage arises from making tradeoffs, not by being a jack-of-all-trades.</p>
<p>Magretta’s book (written with Porter’s cooperation) does a wonderful job of summarising the key lessons and misunderstandings surrounding Porter’s thinking, in an accessible and efficient manner.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Pursue unique value creation rather than being the “best”. Competing to be the biggest/best may not maximise profitability.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Maximum profitability is determined by industry structure (relatively persistent) and the value proposition – but good execution is needed to realise this.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Competitive advantage comes from making a tradeoff – if one way of doing things were strictly better, everyone would do that.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Good strategies require conviction – excessive flexibility reduces competitive advantage.</li>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Core ideas</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The key to competitive success—for businesses and nonprofits alike—lies in an organization’s ability to create unique value. Porter’s prescription: aim to be unique, not best. Creating value, not beating rivals, is at the heart of competition.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>competition is multidimensional, and strategy is about making choices along many dimensions, not just one. No single prescription about which choices to make is valid for every company in every industry.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>These five forces—the intensity of rivalry among existing competitors, the bargaining power of buyers (the industry’s customers), the bargaining power of suppliers, the threat of substitutes, and the threat of new entrants—determine the industry’s structure [...] industry structure determines profitability.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Despite the prevailing sense that business changes with incredible rapidity, Porter discovered that industry structure—once an industry passes beyond its emerging, prestructure phase—tends to be quite stable over time.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Memorizing the five forces won’t make you a better business thinker; it will only help you to sound like one. It matters that you grasp the deeper point: there are a limited number of structural forces at work in every industry that systematically impact profitability in a predictable direction.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Managers often mistakenly assume that a high-growth industry will be an attractive one. But growth is no guarantee that the industry will be profitable. For example, growth might put suppliers in the driver’s seat, or, combined with low entry barriers, growth might attract new rivals. Growth alone says nothing about the power of customers or the availability of substitutes.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Continuity of strategy does not mean that an organization should stand still. As long as there is stability in the core value proposition, there can, and should, be enormous innovation in how it’s delivered.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Bargaining power of buyers/suppliers</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Powerful buyers will force prices down or demand more value in the product, thus capturing more of the value for themselves.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Both industrial customers and consumers tend to be more price sensitive when what they’re buying is expensive relative to their other costs or inconsequential to their own performance</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When you analyze the power of suppliers, be sure to include all of the purchased inputs that go into a product or service, including labor (i.e., your employees). The bargaining power of strong labor unions has been a perennial drag on the airline industry.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>They can credibly threaten to vertically integrate into producing the industry’s product itself. Producers of beer and soft drinks have used this tactic to keep a lid on the prices of beverage containers.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Barriers to entry</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>How do you assess the threat of a substitute? Look to the economics, specifically to whether the substitute offers an attractive price–performance trade-off relative to the industry’s product.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Entry barriers protect an industry from newcomers who would add new capacity and seek to gain market share. The threat of entry dampens profitability in two ways. It caps prices, because higher industry prices would only make entry more attractive for newcomers. At the same time, incumbents typically have to spend more to satisfy their customers.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Do incumbents have advantages independent of size that new entrants can’t access? Examples include proprietary technology, well-established brands, prime locations, and access to distribution channels.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Strategies</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The value chain is a powerful tool for disaggregating a company into its strategically relevant activities in order to focus on the sources of competitive advantage, that is, the specific activities that result in higher prices or lower costs</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Focus refers to the breadth or narrowness of the customers and needs a company serves. Differentiation allows a company to command a premium price. Cost leadership allows it to compete by offering a low relative price. These broad characterizations of strategy types capture the fundamental dimensions of strategic choice relevant in any industry.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If the same value chain can deliver different value propositions equally well, then those value propositions have no strategic relevance.</div></details></p>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Uniqueness vs flexibility</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>If there are no trade-offs, any good idea can be copied. Product features can be copied. Services can be copied. Ways of delivering value can be copied. But where there are trade-offs, the copycat will pay an economic penalty.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Porter calls what McDonald’s tried to do straddling, and it is the most common form of competitive imitation. The straddler, as the word implies, tries to match the benefits of the successful position while at the same time maintaining its existing position. In other words, a straddler tries to have it all, to get the best of two worlds by grafting new features, services, or technologies onto the activities it already performs. Strategy is an either-or realm; the straddler thinks it can escape into a world of both-and. This usually turns out to be wishful thinking.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When you try to offer something for everyone, you tend to relax the trade-offs that underpin your competitive advantage.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Tailoring and trade-offs prevent existing rivals from copying a good strategy, either by straddling or repositioning. The more activities rivals have to reconfigure, the more damage they will do to their current positions. Finally, fit explains how competitive advantage can be sustained against new entrants, even the most determined of them. In competing to be the best, imitation is easy, and advantages are temporary. The more a company competes on uniqueness, the less susceptible it is to imitation, and advantages can be sustained over long periods of time.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A good strategy, consistently maintained over time through repeated interactions with customers, is what gives power to a brand.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Strategy is implicitly a bet that the chosen customers or needs—and the essential trade-offs for meeting them at the right price—will be enduring.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Good strategies have staying power, but there are clearly times when a strategy must be changed. In Porter’s view, these so-called inflection points are relatively rare, and companies are more likely to pull away from their strategies prematurely.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Examples</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Industries with high fixed costs (e.g., telecommunications equipment and offshore drilling) are especially vulnerable to large buyers.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The real profit killer for the airline industry has been the highly unusual combination of low entry barriers and high exit barriers. That’s a very rare configuration of forces. So it’s not all that hard to start a new airline, but if the company goes out of business, the airplanes don’t go away. Airplanes are what we call fungible assets, that is, they can be used by any carrier, on almost any route, at any time. So the plane can change ownership, but the capacity never leaves the market until the plane literally falls apart.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Regulation can hold an industry in an artificial equilibrium by defining customer needs in an arbitrary way. Deregulation can unleash pent-up economic forces, allowing new needs to emerge. Major structural changes in an industry often require new strategic positions.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>When all else fails and pressure on prices has destroyed an industry’s profitability, often the remedy is to limit competition through consolidation.</p>

<p>There are so many barriers that distract, deter, and divert managers from making clear strategic choices. Some of the most significant barriers come from the many hidden biases embedded in internal systems, organizational structures, and decision-making processes.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>7 Powers</em> is a classic MBA strategy book – the kind of thing that technical people (like software engineers) make jokes about. There is a tonne of jargon, lots of alliteration, and most of the book is spent reframing the world in the author&#39;s framework.</p>
<p>But the truth is that I really enjoyed the book. <em>7 Powers</em> is a digestible but comprehensive look at the subject of &quot;competitive advantage&quot; – value investors endlessly preach about the importance of finding a company with a moat (like Buffett&#39;s investment in Coca Cola due to its branding) but don&#39;t offer much advice in the way of characterising a moat. <em>7 Powers</em> details seven ways in which a company can build durable differential margins, ranging from the obvious ones like Branding and Scale/Network Economies to more subtle factors like counter-positioning (Netflix) and process power (Toyota).</p>
<p>Filled with tangible examples as well as sufficient generalisation and clear diagrams for future reference, the <em>7 Powers</em> is clearly designed to be used practically.</p>

<p>I came across this book while listening to Episode 174 of the Invest Like The Best podcast (Patrick O&#39;Shaughnessy) and the concepts were interesting enough to warrant a read of the book. But if you don&#39;t have time to read the book, the podcast is a fantastic summary.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fundamental Equation of Strategy.</strong> Value = M0 * g * s * m. The interpretation of this is that Value = Market Size * Power. M0 is the current market size, g is a discounted growth factor for the market, s is long-term average market share and m is long-term average differential margins (the profit margin above that needed to return the cost of capital). I have found that the explicit tying of Strategy concepts to the exact determinants of the net present value of free cash flow puts to rest a lot of fuzzy thinking about the relationship between Strategy and value. It has also helped me as an active equity investor. It is important that s and m are long-term equilibrium values. Short-term movements in these have little impact on fundamental value.</p>

<p>[To achieve Power] two components must be simultaneously present: A Benefit : some condition which yields material improvement in the cash flow of the Power wielder via reduced cost, enhanced pricing and/or decreased investment requirements.</p>
<p>A Barrier : some obstacle which engenders in competitors an inability and/or unwillingness to engage in behaviors that might, over time, arbitrage out this benefit.</p>

<p>The 3 S’s. Power, the potential to realize persistent differential returns, is the key to value creation. Power is created if a business attribute is simultaneously:</p>
<p>Superior—improves free cash flow</p>
<p>Significant—the cash flow improvement must be material</p>
<p>Sustainable—the improvement must be largely immune to competitive arbitrage</p>
<p>In this book I have focused on Benefit + Barrier which has a one-to-one mapping to the 3 S’s (Superior + Significant = Benefit and Sustainable = Barrier). However, in the field, the tripartite 3 S test of Power proves useful additionally because, since it calls out “Significant” separately, it makes materiality explicit. For example, businesses often tout network effects but, when looked at carefully, they are not material and therefore do not qualify as Power.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reading this book, there were many times that I wanted to quit and read something else, but the irony was quite tangible so I soldiered on.</p>
<p><em>Grit</em> is an important book; it emphasises that &quot;genius&quot; in the intellectual sense is completely overrated. What distinguishes successful people is the ironclad focus and determination they have in pursuing their goals. It&#39;s a particularly useful book for parents and teachers because even small things like the vocabulary you use when a child makes a mistake can have a big impact on their attitude and growth.</p>
<p>This said, I really didn&#39;t enjoy reading it. I can&#39;t pinpoint anything in particular – perhaps I just couldn&#39;t click with the writing style. I would instead recommend <a href="/?books=black-box-thinking" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Black Box Thinking</a> which includes a couple of paragraphs from <em>Grit</em> , has similar key messages, yet is far more engaging.</p>

<p>“Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of the genius,” Nietzsche said. “For if we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking. . . . To call someone ‘divine’ means: ‘here there is no need to compete.’ ”</p>

<p>Kaizen is Japanese for resisting the plateau of arrested development. Its literal translation is: “continuous improvement.” A while back, the idea got some traction in American business culture when it was touted as the core principle behind Japan’s spectacularly efficient manufacturing economy. After interviewing dozens and dozens of grit paragons, I can tell you that they all exude kaizen. There are no exceptions.</p>

<p>“We’ve actually tracked senior leaders here at Vanguard and asked why some did better in the long run than others. I used to use the word ‘complacency’ to describe the ones who didn’t work out, but the more I reflect on it, the more I realize that’s not quite it. It’s really a belief that ‘I can’t learn anymore. I am what I am. This is how I do things.’ ” And what about executives who ultimately excelled? “The people who have continued to be successful here have stayed on a growth trajectory. They just keep surprising you with how much they’re growing. We’ve had people who, if you looked at their résumé coming in, you’d say, ‘Wow, how did that person end up so successful?’ And we’ve had other people come in with incredible credentials, and you’re wondering, ‘Why did they not go further?’ ”</p>

<p>Jamie has a favorite Teddy Roosevelt quote he likes to repeat: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. And here is how Jamie translates the poetry of Roosevelt into the prose of a JPMorgan Chase manual, titled How We Do Business: “Have a fierce resolve in everything you do.” “Demonstrate determination, resiliency, and tenacity.” “Do not let temporary setbacks become permanent excuses.” And, finally, “Use mistakes and problems as opportunities to get better—not reasons to quit.”</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Though <em>Margin of Safety</em> is slightly more advanced than many other of its &quot;investment classics&quot; and perhaps not as applicable for a beginning investor (in Klarman&#39;s own words, it is &quot;not a book about investing, but a book about thinking about investing&quot;), it is probably one of the clearest manifestos for value investing. However, unlike the standard &quot;cultish&quot; value investment you occasionally come across, Klarman’s take is mature and logical, without any sense of entitlement and acutely aware of its own weaknesses.</p>
<p><em>Margin of Safety</em> covers a couple of obscure (and technical) areas, such as spinoffs, distressed investing, and financial thrift conversions, but you don&#39;t have to understand all of what he says to be able to extract value from the book. I think it makes for a good “second-book” on value investing, i.e as a followup to a more accessible read like <a href="/?books=one-up-on-wall-street" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">One Up On Wall Street</a> or Joel Greenblatt&#39;s books.</p>

<p>hundreds of billions of dollars are invested in virtual or complete ignorance of underlying business fundamentals, often using indexing strategies designed to avoid significant underperformance at the cost of assured mediocrity.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Value investors, by contrast, have as a primary goal the preservation of their capital. It follows that value investors seek a margin of safety, allowing room for imprecision, bad luck, or analytical error in order to avoid sizable losses over time. A margin of safety is necessary because valuation is an imprecise art, the future is unpredictable, and investors are human and do make mistakes. It is adherence to the concept of a margin of safety that best distinguishes value investors from all others, who are not as concerned about loss.</p>

<p>Investors should pay attention not only to whether but also to why current holdings are undervalued. It is critical to know why you have made an investment and to sell when the reason for owning it no longer applies. Look for investments with catalysts that may assist directly in the realization of underlying value. Give preference to companies having good managements with a personal financial stake in the business. Finally, diversify your holdings and hedge when it is financially attractive to do so.</p>

<p>great many professional investors employ a top-down approach. This involves making a prediction about the future, ascertaining its investment implications, and then acting upon them. This approach is difficult and risky, being vulnerable to error at every step. Practitioners need to accurately forecast macroeconomic conditions and then correctly interpret their impact on various sectors of the overall economy, on particular industries, and finally on specific companies.</p>

<p>Depreciation allowances contribute to cash but must eventually be used to fund capital expenditures that are necessary to replace worn-out plant and equipment. Capital expenditures are thus a direct offset to depreciation allowances; the former is as certain a use of cash as the latter is a source. The timing may differ: a company may invest heavily in plant and equipment at one point and afterward generate depreciation allowances well in excess of current capital spending. Whenever the plant and equipment need to be replaced, however, cash must be available. If capital spending is less than depreciation over a long period of time, a company is undergoing gradual liquidation.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Even when a company has little ongoing business value, investors who buy at a price below net-net working capital are protected by the approximate liquidation value of current assets alone. As long as working capital is not overstated and operations are not rapidly consuming cash, a company could liquidate its assets, extinguish all its liabilities, and still distribute proceeds in excess of the market price to investors. Ongoing business losses can, however, quickly erode net-net working capital. Investors must therefore always consider the state of a company’s current operations before buying.</p>

<p>Soros’s theory of reflexivity makes the point that its stock price can at times significantly influence the value of a business. Investors must not lose sight of this possibility.</p>
<p>If, for example, an undercapitalized bank has a high stock price, it can issue more shares and become adequately capitalized, a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. The stock market says there is no problem, so there is no problem.</p>

<p>There are only a few things investors can do to counteract risk: diversify adequately, hedge when appropriate, and invest with a margin of safety. It is precisely because we do not and cannot know all the risks of an investment that we strive to invest at a discount. The bargain element helps to provide a cushion for when things go wrong.</p>

<p>The primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing money. Three elements of a value-investment strategy make achievement of that goal possible. A bottom-up approach, searching for low-risk bargains one at a time through fundamental analysis, is the surest way I know to avoid losing money. An absolute-performance orientation is consistent with loss avoidance; a relative-performance orientation is not. Finally, paying careful attention to risk-the probability and amount of loss due to permanent value impairments-will help investors avoid losing money.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>More Money Than God</em> is a reasonably comprehensive history of hedge funds, from the Great Depression until just after the global financial crisis. It’s an accessible look into some of the trades that shaped modern capitalism and central bank policy, for example, Soros and Druckenmiller forcing multiple major currency devaluations (not just breaking the Bank of England) and Paulson&#39;s short on the housing market in 2006.</p>
<p>The more time I’ve spent around finance practitioners, the more I’ve come to understand the importance of market history. It’s not just about knowing what tactics have worked successfully and what mistakes to avoid (though both of these matter) – rather, the major value is in having a common <em>vocabulary</em> . The people and the trades discussed in the book are part of hedgies’ collective culture, in the same way that Western thought stands on the shoulders of giants like Plato.</p>
<p>In addition to market history, <em>More Money Than God</em> constantly questions whether hedge funds are a net plus or minus for the world. I think quite a balanced picture is given for macro, arbitrage and L/S equity funds, but these are relatively simple cases where I think it’s hard to argue that there is a net negative. The more difficult cases of HFT firms and vulture funds aren’t discussed, so perhaps the book skews to the positive side.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Soros and Druck</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Having digested arguments from the quasi science of economics, the quasi philosophy of reflexivity, and the quasi psychology of the charts, Soros arrived at an investment conclusion. It was time to short the dollar.</p>

<p>At the height of the sterling crisis, John Major effectively bought sterling from Stan Druckenmiller at a price both knew to be absurd. Major did this for a reason that appears nowhere in financial texts: He wanted to force political rivals to share responsibility for devaluation. Druckenmiller’s coup also served to show that currency pegs were vulnerable in a world of deep and liquid markets. During the 1950s and 1960s, the system of fixed currencies worked well because regulations restricted the flow of capital across borders; but now that these controls were gone, it was time for governments to accept the limits to their power over money. They could either use interest rates to manage the value of their currency, so dampening exchange-rate swings, or they could use them to manage their economic ups and downs, so dampening recessions. Attempts to have it both ways via “flexible pegs” such as the exchange-rate mechanism were likely to backfire: The contrast between the United States and Europe illustrated the point vividly. When the Bush administration had tried and failed to lift the dollar in August, no calamity had ensued; the dollar was floating anyway, so there was no sudden break in its fortunes. But the currency pegs of Finland, Italy, Britain, and Sweden were a different matter; they presented speculators with targets that were too appealing to pass up, exposing their economies to wrenching dislocations. In committing to the exchange-rate mechanism, European governments had made a promise that they lacked the ability to keep. They had bottled up currency movements until a power greater than themselves had blown the cork into their faces. The implications of a world featuring Druckenmiller and other macro investors were not immediately absorbed by policy makers. As happens after every financial crisis, the first instinct was to vilify the markets rather than to learn the awkward lessons that they teach: in this case, that currency pegs were dangerous.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For a country to choose sky-high interest rates in preference to devaluation was “sheer lunacy,” Jones wrote, and he invoked Keynes’s reflections on this folly going back to Roman times. In A.D. 274, Emperor Aurelian’s zeal to protect the integrity of the coinage caused deflationary misery and provoked a rebellion.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Soros and Druckenmiller did not simply lead an attack pack of trend followers against every currency indiscriminately. On the contrary, they actually made money betting that the French franc would resist pressure for devaluation.</p>
<p><em>Part of the story that’s rarely told. e.g Soros and Druck went LONG sterling after Black Wednesday. That’s what separates the greats from legends.</em></p>

Rather than closing out its yen short, as the market expected, it should demonstrate its fearlessness by adding to its bet against Japan’s currency. One brave gesture would prove to predatory traders that it was not easy meat. The yen would stop speeding upward.</p>
<p>“The yen, which was as liquid as water, suddenly dried up like the Sahara,” he pleaded to his investors, failing to add that liquidity had evaporated not least because of Tiger’s recklessness. Tiger had been short an astonishing $18 billion worth of the currency—a position almost twice as large as Druckenmiller’s famous bet against sterling. By trading currencies even more ambitiously than his rivals at Quantum, Robertson had baked his own Sahara.</p>

<p>Greenlight’s founder, David Einhorn, could not resist having a go: He took a large short position in Chemdex in September 1999, when the company’s stock was trading at $26. But in the unhinged atmosphere of the bubble, even the most questionable accounting failed to faze other investors. In December, Queen Mary of Morgan Stanley declared, “We think Chemdex has got what it takes,” and by February the stock had risen more than sixfold, to a mind-bending $164. Needless to say, by late 2000 Chemdex had collapsed to $2 per share. But that was too late to help Einhorn, who was forced out of his Chemdex short before the bubble burst, nursing enormous losses.</p>

<p>**<em>On LTCM</em> **</p>
<p>Meriwether and his partners came to be seen as the victims of a reckless faith in their models—which fueled the belief that some modest addition of caution could prevent similar disasters. But the truth was both more subtle and harder to live with. LTCM’s risk management was more nuanced and sophisticated than critics imagined, and the lessons drawn from its failure included several prescriptions that LTCM itself had implemented. In the course of the ensuing decade, there were calls for value-at-risk calculations to be supplemented with stress tests; LTCM had done that. There were calls for financial institutions to pay attention to liquidity risks; LTCM had done that. And yet LTCM failed anyway, not because its approach to calculating risk was simplistic but because getting the calculations right is extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p>The partners’ faith in arbitrage, exaggerated at the best of times, was now 180 degrees off target—arbitrage had been replaced by a kind of reverse arbitrage. The unwinding of each arbitrage portfolio damaged all the other ones: The cycle was self-reinforcing.</p>

<p>But even if funds make every effort to report their results honestly, they cannot help but “smooth” them. A hedge fund may estimate the value of an illiquid asset every few weeks; if it rises 5 percent and then falls back within that period, it will be recorded simply as flat—with the result that some sharp volatility along the way is not acknowledged. As a result, hedge funds with illiquid assets are not as stable as their numbers suggest. Their risk-adjusted returns look wonderful because some of the risk goes unreported.</p>

<p>Marek Fludzinski, the head of a hedge-fund company called Thales, tested virtually identical trading strategies to see if the presence of one of them would erode the other one’s returns; remarkably, it did not, suggesting that crowding was not actually a problem. It was true that uncrowded bets could suddenly feel intensely crowded in a moment of turmoil; but this held for virtually all trading strategies, not just quantitative ones. “Of course, ‘good investing gets clocked as some investors rush for exits’ is not as catchy a story as ‘quant brainiacs follow their computers to a well-deserved doom,’ so I’m probably not going to win this battle in the media,” Asness lamented.</p>
<p><em>Quant is not uniquely exposed to left tail correlation.</em></p>

<p>Whereas large parts of the financial system have proved too big to fail, hedge funds are generally small enough to fail. When they blow up, they cost taxpayers nothing.</p>

<p>HEDGE FUNDS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ESPECIALLY prone to insider trading or fraud. They offer a partial answer to the too-big-to-fail problem. They deliver value to investors. And they are more likely to blunt trends than other types of investment vehicle. For all these reasons, regulators should want to encourage hedge funds, not rein them in.</p>

<p>There are ways for hedge funds to game the Sharpe ratio by behaving like undercapitalized insurance companies. For example, a fund can sell options that insure against extreme swings in the market. For months and maybe years, the insurer will collect a steady stream of premiums from these options, delivering consistent, market-beating returns; but one day the extreme market swing will occur, at which point the fund will go bankrupt.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My general philosophy to learning is that it is much more important to know what you don&#39;t know than to think you know something. For that reason, I am often a fan of the <em>Very Short Introduction</em> series and the like.</p>
<p>This is not an easy genre to master – it’s very difficult to strike the right balance between breadth and depth. Burkov&#39;s book does a great job of it, providing a brilliant executive summary of the entire machine learning landscape (insofar as that is possible). The book is not for pure laymen, though should suffice for the &quot;determined amateur&quot; confident with high-school maths.</p>
<p>I found it to be a nice refresher, as well as a useful survey of some of the recent art in the ML world. I’d definitely recommend it if you want a rough understanding of how several different ML methods work, but the book is probably not suitable if you are looking for a broader picture of how ML will change the world, or specific business applications etc.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Lessons of History</em> is a delightful little book. Durant manages to summarise a lifetime&#39;s worth of meticulous historical study into 100-odd pages of beautiful prose. Each chapter explores a certain topic, for example <em>History and Politics</em> or <em>History and War</em> , illuminating how that particular theme has shaped the world we live in. Durant mingles a realistic acceptance of the brutality of history with a subtle optimism – vaguely reminiscent of Camus&#39; absurdism (see <a href="/?books=the-myth-of-sisyphus" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Myth of Sisyphus</a>).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t agree with all of Durant&#39;s conclusions (or even statements) – Durant makes occasional remarks about society&#39;s immorality, using a Western Christian frame of reference. But that doesn&#39;t much detract from my enjoyment of the book. It is concise, beautifully written, and incredibly thought-provoking.</p>

<p>We accept these possibilities in our stride, and retort to the cosmos in the words of Pascal: “When the universe has crushed him man will still be nobler than that which kills him, because he knows that he is dying, and of its victory the universe knows nothing.”</p>

<p>Leave men free, and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically, as in England and America in the nineteenth century under laissez-faire. To check the growth of inequality, liberty must be sacrificed, as in Russia after 1917. Even when repressed, inequality grows; only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom; and in the end superior ability has its way.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>If history supports any theology this would be a dualism like the Zoroastrian or Manichaean: a good spirit and an evil spirit battling for control of the universe and men’s souls.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In one way Christianity lent a hand against itself by developing in many Christians a moral sense that could no longer stomach the vengeful God of the traditional theology.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Generally religion and puritanism prevail in periods when the laws are feeble and morals must bear the burden of maintaining social order; skepticism and paganism (other factors being equal) progress as the rising power of law and government permits the decline of the church, the family, and morality without basically endangering the stability of the state.</p>
<p><em>Yikes – kinda comes across as a religious fundamentalist here</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We frolic in our emancipation from theology, but have we developed a natural ethic—a moral code independent of religion—strong enough to keep our instincts of acquisition, pugnacity, and sex from debasing our civilization into a mire of greed, crime, and promiscuity?</p>

<p>bankers have sat in the councils of governments, financing wars and popes, and occasionally sparking a revolution. Perhaps it is one secret of their power that, having studied the fluctuations of prices, they know that history is inflationary, and that money is the last thing a wise man will hoard.</p>
<p><em>Power comes from capital assets, not piles of cash. See Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, and the rest of the titans.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In progressive societies the concentration may reach a point where the strength of number in the many poor rivals the strength of ability in the few rich; then the unstable equilibrium generates a critical situation, which history has diversely met by legislation redistributing wealth or by revolution distributing poverty.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation.</p>

<p>Augustus organized, under what in effect was monarchical rule, the greatest achievement in the history of statesmanship—that Pax Romana which maintained peace from 30 B.C. to A.D. 180 throughout an empire ranging from the Atlantic to the Euphrates and from Scotland to the Black Sea. After him monarchy disgraced itself under Caligula, Nero, and Domitian; but after them came Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius—“the finest succession of good and great sovereigns,”</p>

<p>All deductions having been made, democracy has done less harm, and more good, than any other form of government. It gave to human existence a zest and camaraderie that outweighed its pitfalls and defects. It gave to thought and science and enterprise the freedom essential to their operation and growth. It broke down the walls of privilege and class, and in each generation it raised up ability from every rank and place.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If race or class war divides us into hostile camps, changing political argument into blind hate, one side or the other may overturn the hustings with the rule of the sword. If our economy of freedom fails to distribute wealth as ably as it has created it, the road to dictatorship will be open to any man who can persuasively promise security to all; and a martial government, under whatever charming phrases, will engulf the democratic world.</p>

<p>The general smiles. “You have forgotten all the lessons of history,” he says, “and all that nature of man which you described. Some conflicts are too fundamental to be resolved by negotiation; and during the prolonged negotiations (if history may be our guide) subversion would go on.

<p>“History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque.” Perhaps, within these limits, we can learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another’s delusions.</p>

<p>An age of weary skepticism and epicureanism followed the triumph of rationalism over mythology in the last century before Christianity, and follows a similar victory today in the first century after Christianity.</p>

<p>One of the discouraging discoveries of our disillusioning century is that science is neutral: it will kill for us as readily as it will heal, and will destroy for us more readily than it can build.</p>

<p>Has all the progress of philosophy since Descartes been a mistake through its failure to recognize the role of myth in the consolation and control of man? “He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow, and in much wisdom is much grief.”</p>

<p>The historian will not mourn because he can see no meaning in human existence except that which man puts into it; let it be our pride that we ourselves may put meaning into our lives, and sometimes a significance that transcends death. If a man is fortunate he will, before he dies, gather up as much as he can of his civilized heritage and transmit it to his children. And to his final breath he will be grateful for this inexhaustible legacy, knowing that it is our nourishing mother and our lasting life.</p>

<p>I particularly remember the time I gave him my paper on the banking industry. I felt very proud of my work. However, he read through it and said, “This is useless. What makes the stock go up and down?” That comment acted as a spur. Thereafter, I focused my analysis on seeking to identify the factors that were strongly correlated to a stock’s price movement as opposed to looking at all the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The way to build long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs. You can be far more aggressive when you’re making good profits. Many managers, once they’re up 30 or 40 percent, will book their year [i.e., trade very cautiously for the remainder of the year so as not to jeopardize the very good return that has already been realized]. The way to attain truly superior long-term returns is to grind it out until you’re up 30 or 40 percent, and then if you have the convictions, go for a 100 percent year. If you can put together a few near-100 percent years and avoid down years, then you can achieve really outstanding long-term returns.</p>

<p>My approach is to confront losses even before they materialize. I rehearse the process of losing. Whenever I take a position, I like to imagine what it would be like under the worst-case scenario. In doing so, I minimize the confusion if that situation actually develops. In my view, losses are a very important part of trading. When a loss happens, I believe in embracing it. Why is that? By embracing a loss, really feeling it, I tend to have less fear about a potential loss the next time around.</p>

<p>I would look for people with the ability to admit mistakes and take losses quickly. Most people view losing as a hit against their self-esteem. As a result, they postpone losing. They think of all sorts of reasons for not taking losses. They select a mental stop point and then fail to execute it. They abandon their game plan.</p>

<p>Many traders tend to set their stops at or near the previous high or low. This behavioral pattern holds true for both major and minor price moves. When there is a heavy concentration of such stops, you can be reasonably sure that the locals on the floor are aware of this information. There will be a tendency for the locals to buy as prices approach a concentration of buy stops above the market (or to sell if the market approaches heavy sell stops below the market). The locals try to profit by anticipating that the activation of a large pocket of stops will cause a minor extension of the price move. They will then use such a price extension as an opportunity to liquidate their positions for a quick profit.[...]The primary point I’m trying to make is that key chart patterns are often based on the activity of the professionals on the floors.</p>

<p>it’s one thing to recognize that the tails are fatter than normal, and it’s another to know where to go from there. For example. do you simply fit your distribution to your empirical observations, and price options accordingly? That path has some serious problems. Do you take into account your hedging strategy? Are there other variables that none of the available models allow for? And, if there are, would their inclusion introduce so much complexity into the model as to make its application unweildly? In other words, knowing that the distribution isn’t log-normal only opens a can of worms. Frankly, though, I still can’t understand why back then the competition hadn’t at least gotten the lid off the can.</p>

<p>You mentioned that speculators are usually on the buy side of options. In general, do you believe there is a mispricing that occurs because people like to buy options? If you compare historical graphs of implied volatility versus historical volatility across a spectrum of markets, you will see a distinct tendency for implied volatility being higher—a pattern that suggests that such a bias exists.</p>

<p>Covered calls [buying a stock and selling a call against it] are frequently promoted as trading strategies. As we both know, doing a covered call is identical to selling a put. Is there ever any strategic rationale for implementing a covered call instead of a short put, or is the former promoted because it involves a double commission, or perhaps for semantic reasons—that is, even though the two trades are identical, the covered call sounds like a less risky proposition than a short put position?</p>
<p>I don’t know how to articulate the fraud that is sometimes perpetrated on the public. A lot of strategies promoted by brokers do not serve the interest of their clients at all. I almost feel guilty when taking the other side of a covered call position, because it’s obvious that the customer is operating under a misconception.</p>

<p>For example, one time Alcoa closed at $49 and the 45 call was trading only $2 1/2 above the 50 call. By buying the 45 call and selling the 50 call, I would lose $2 1/2 if the stock went down $4 or more, but I would win $2 1/2 if the stock went up $1 or more. It seemed like a great bet.

<p>Assume that you’re certain that you have the best hand, and the last card has just been dealt. What do you do? A novice trader would say, “I would bet the limit.” However, that is often not the right move—even if you’re sure that your opponent will call. Why? Because sometimes when you pass, he’ll bet, giving you the opportunity to raise, in which case you’ll win double the bet size.</p>

<p>A current example is NCR, which is a takeover target of AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T’s bid is $110, and the stock is currently trading at approximately $106. If the takeover goes through, the buyer of the stock stands to make about $2. (About half of the difference between the current price and the takeover bid represents interest rate costs on carrying the stock.) If, on the other hand, the takeover falls through, then the stock can drop sharply—to about $75 based on current market estimates. In this particular case, the relatively close calls are essentially worthless, because the stock is unlikely to go above $110. On the other hand, the much further out-of-the-money 90 puts have some chance of gaining significant value in the event the takeover fails. Thus, in this type of situation, the out-of-the-money puts will be priced much higher than the equivalent out-of-the-money calls.</p>

<p>Because of the way our brains process language, which is literally, NLP recommends taking negative thoughts and stating them in positive terms. Instead of saying what you don’t want, state what you do want. Instead of advising a trader, “Don’t think about the money,” it would be far more effective to say, “Focus your attention on following your method.”</p>

<p>An effective trading strategy will have the following characteristics. First, it will be automatic. Given a specific situation, the trader will know what to do without second-guessing himself. Second, a good strategy will be congruent—that is, it won’t create any internal conflict. Third, the strategy will incorporate Away From motivation by including some specific risk control plans. Fourth, part of the strategy will involve imagining the trade from the perspective of already being in the position and considering what might be wrong with the trade before putting it on. Fifth, an effective trading strategy will provide specific evidence that will allow the trader to evaluate the merits of a trade.</p>

<p>Pete Steidlmayer says he’s “solving the markets.” Paul Tudor Jones sums it up with, “It’s a game, and money is a way to keep score.” Each operating metaphor will lead a trader’s brain to a different set of beliefs and a different approach to the markets, with some being more effective than others. Contrast the metaphors I just cited with some of the operating metaphors I’ve typically heard around the trading floor. “I got torn up today,” makes the market into a beast of prey. “We took a hit” reflects thinking that the market is a war and the speaker a wounded participant. Which metaphor will result in your feeling more objective about the market—playing a game, even a high-stakes game, or defending yourself from an attacking wild animal? The answer is obvious.</p>

<p>I also think there is a great deal of merit to Faulkner’s list of the six key steps in achievement: Use both Toward and Away From motivation. Have a goal of full capability plus, with anything less being unacceptable. Break down potentially overwhelming goals into chunks, with satisfaction garnered from the completion of each individual step. Fully concentrate on the present moment of time—that is, the single task at hand rather than the long-term goal. Personally involve yourself in achieving goals (as opposed to depending on others). Make self-to-self comparisons to measure progress.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>God I love this book. <em>Sirens</em> is my favourite Vonnegut novel, and certainly in my top 10 favourite reads.</p>
<p>The viciously dry humour is highly reminiscent of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (it turns out that Adams specifically cited <em>Sirens</em> as an influence). But Vonnegut’s mastery is tying this humour with <em>heart</em>, parrying his cynicism with subtle, careful optimism.</p>
<p><em>Sirens</em> takes classic Vonnegut themes – the stupidity of War (similar to <em>Catch-22)</em>, the role of religion, the meaning of life (or lack thereof) – and presents them in a way that is simultaneously hilarious (The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent) and harrowing (the massacre of the Martians).</p>
<p>While Vonnegut is more widely known for <em>Slaughterhouse</em> and <a href="/?books=cats-cradle" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Cat’s Cradle</a> (excellent novels in their own right), I emphatically believe that <em>Sirens</em> is his magnum opus.</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=advances-in-financial-machine-learning"/>
        <updated>2021-12-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Edit as of 2024</em> *</strong>: the more time I spend in this industry, the less I think of this book.*</p>
<p><em>Advances in Financial Machine Learning</em> (<em>AFML</em> ) is a classic text in the nascent field of financial machine learning. No book is going to contain working strategies (please point me to one if you think otherwise!) and de Prado is up front about this. Instead, <em>AFML</em> contains an array of different techniques that may or may not be useful.</p>
<p>I generally enjoy books like this. At a high level, my philosophy to knowledge is squarely in the camp of “know what you don’t know”. It doesn’t really matter to me that I don’t know exactly how to make fractionally differentiated features (chapter 5) – as long as I know what situations it might be useful, and what the pitfalls are. I can always look up the method later, and if I’m lucky, find an implementation on GitHub!</p>
<p>That said, the danger with this approach is that you end up with a scattered set of ideas with little filtration, limiting the utility (e.g. <a href="/?books=a-practical-guide-to-forecasting-financial-market-volatility" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">A Practical Guide to Forecasting Financial Market Volatility</a>). The role of an author is to cut through the noise, drawing on their professional/academic experience to help the reader develop a mapping of “situation ←→ relevant tool”. Euan Sinclair does this amazingly well (see e.g. <a href="/?books=volatility-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Volatility Trading</a>).</p>
<p>When I first read <em>AFML</em> I was wowed by it. In the years since I have come to believe (partially due to my exposure to excellent books like those of Sinclair) that <em>AFML</em> has not managed this tradeoff well. The book is overly mathematical, making little attempt to outline practical use-cases (let alone intuition!). I much preferred <em>Machine Learning for Trading</em> by Stefan Jansen.</p>
<p>This said, there are certainly gems in the book. I particularly enjoyed chapters 6-14, which explicitly deal with applications of machine learning techniques like ensemble methods and feature importance to finance. Chapter 1 (available for free on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3104847">SSRN</a>) is a good take on the philosophy behind applying ML to finance. I only wish this wisdom effused from the remaining</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although I picked this up with the intention of reading only <em>Scientific Advertising</em> , <em>My Life in Advertising</em> actually turned out to be well worth a read. It’s an interesting mixture of biography and life lessons, though as Hopkins notes, he doesn&#39;t bring anything up unless it has pedagogical value.</p>
<p>Hopkins had a clear understanding of what makes people tick. Some of this, I&#39;m sure, is innate. But probably the biggest reason is simply the amount of time he put in – 18-hour workdays were not uncommon for him. <em>My Life in Advertising</em> shares the things he discovered through all of this effort.</p>
<p>While the volumes feel dated at times (Hopkins died in 1932), his scientific approach seems as relevant as ever. <em>Scientific Advertising</em> , the second book, is a succinct summary of all of the lessons in the former so it&#39;s worth looking at if one doesn&#39;t have the inclination to read his biography.</p>

<p>The average man is not successful. We meet few who attain their goal, few who are really happy or content. Then why should we let the majority rule in matters affecting our lives?</p>

        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-three-body-problem</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-three-body-problem"/>
        <updated>2021-12-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Though I tend to prefer to read books over a couple of days to digest them better, <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> was very difficult to put down, so I ended up reading it in one sitting.</p>
<p>It is what a science fiction book <em>should</em> be. Initially set in Red China, <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> masterfully weaves political and historical threads into a plausible but thrilling SF storyline – it is rare for a scifi novel to excel on a dimension other than the science. But Liu doesn’t sacrifice on the science either: <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> is hard science fiction (at times, approaching the hardness of Greg Egan), fundamentally centred around the impossibility of finding an analytical solution to predict the motion of three bodies.</p>
<p>Without giving away any details, the plot is quite reminiscent of Asimov’s <em>The Gods Themselves –</em> there is a generally militant alien race with some pacifist individuals. Why would we expect an intelligent race of aliens to be politically united? Maybe conflict and disagreement is part and parcel of sentience.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The farmer hypothesis, on the other hand, has the flavor of a horror story: Every morning on a turkey farm, the farmer comes to feed the turkeys. A scientist turkey, having observed this pattern to hold without change for almost a year, makes the following discovery: “Every morning at eleven, food arrives.” On the morning of Thanksgiving, the scientist announces this law to the other turkeys. But that morning at eleven, food doesn’t arrive; instead, the farmer comes and kills the entire flock.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Our definition of ‘life’ is probably not appropriate for the high-dimensional microcosmos. More accurately, we can only say that universe contains intelligence or wisdom. Scientists have long predicted this possibility. It would have been odd for such a complex and vast world to not have evolved something akin to intelligence.”</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=a-scanner-darkly"/>
        <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The archetypal PKD novel has brilliant ideas, some elements of existential horror, and some ‘weirdness’ in the writing style. In <em>Martian Time Slip</em> and <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em> , the strangeness of the writing detracts from the overall experience. However, in books like <a href="/?books=ubik" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Ubik</a>, that same peculiarity clicks perfectly, making the novel unforgettable.</p>
<p>While not quite as good as <em>Ubik</em> (an extremely high bar), <em>A Scanner Darkly</em> is both thrilling and accessible. The science-fiction elements are fascinating, but as with most PKD it doesn’t <em>feel</em> like science fiction. Instead, you’re plunged into a bleak world where all of the technological advancements are part of the weary routine, leaving the focus on the human condition.</p>
<p><em>A Scanner Darkly</em> deals with a hyper-addictive drug that is also extremely toxic, leading to terrifying cognitive fractures. The book draws from PKD’s own drug experiences, adding a disturbing authenticity to the hallucinations. <em>Scanner</em> was oftentimes legitimately unsettling – while reading it I had a weird dream that I was Bob Arctor... NOT cool (if you’re familiar with the plot you will understand why this wasn’t fun). All told, it’s a great PKD novel, and on a side note, the semi-animated film adaptation (starring Keanu Reeves and RDJ) was also very worthwhile.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Algorithms to Live By</em> is the rare non-fiction book that consistently presents sophisticated concepts with stunning clarity, but more surprisingly, offers practical advice on how to optimise many areas of your life. It is a partial antidote to the poor decision-making documented by behavioural scientists: many everyday problems you may encounter in life are really computer science problems in disguise, and luckily, some of these problems have known solutions (though one must carefully reason about the applicability of the simplified model).</p>
<p>For example, optimal stopping problems. If you know that you want to be married in the next 10 years, for how long should you date before deciding to settle down? Using the 1/e rule, you should date for just under 4 years before settling for the first partner who is &#39;better&#39; than all your exes (note this is not quite true because this assumes that you can’t get back together with an ex).</p>
<p>Another interesting example is caches and queues. What&#39;s the best way to sort a stack of research papers? It turns out that leaving it as a pile on your desk and putting the last paper you read on top of the pile, while seemingly messy, is actually pretty close to optimal.</p>
<p>Rationality is a key theme in the book, especially so in the last chapter on game theory. While this part of the book did not offer as much practical advice as the preceding chapters, it introduced a fascinating argument that &#39;irrational love&#39; is actually of rational utility, ensuring that you are &#39;partners in crime&#39; in the prisoner&#39;s dilemma.</p>
<p>All this said, the book never oversteps its bounds: it is self-aware and fully conscious of the limitations of the methods. It hasn’t given me <em>answers</em> , but rather <em>mental models</em> . There is really nothing more I could want from a non-fiction book.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Armageddon in Retrospect</em> is a collection of 12 short essays or stories from the man himself, mostly about the atrocities he witnessed in World War 2 at Dresden. It is hard to be humorous about such a topic; these writings don’t drip with Vonnegut’s typical satirical jabs. But for those who see Vonnegut as a brashly obscene cynic, Armageddon is very humanising and it brings Vonnegut down to earth from whatever planet he’s from. In his words:</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought <em>Better</em> would be something like <em>The</em> <em>Checklist Manifesto</em> , offering extensive practical evidence on a methodology for improving overall performance. But actually it was more like a collection of anecdotes and observations on the broad subject of ‘performance’ in hospital environments. This is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>I think there are many useful lessons from surgery that apply to other professions. What interested me most was the concept of “positive deviance”, i.e being an individual on the far right side of the bell curve. Gawande notes that it is extremely difficult to reach and remain in this elusive subset – doing so requires a constant emphasis on excellence, always collecting performance data and balancing self-criticism with open-mindedness.</p>
<p>Overall I think this <em>Better</em> is a good exposition on the difficulty of achieving/maintaining high performance in the medical field, with lessons that could extend to other areas where high performance is similarly necessary (e.g law and finance).</p>

<p>Finally, there is the maneuver that no one wanted to put his name to but that has saved many babies&#39; lives through history: you fracture the clavicles--the collar bones--and pull the baby out.</p>

<p>What is troubling is not just being average but settling for it. Everyone knows that averageness is, for most of us, our fate.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#39;t feel very comfortable giving this book five stars, because it is the work of a rambling pretentious author who tries to be too introspective and self-aware with his &#39;art&#39;. But I&#39;m not talking about Nabokov. I&#39;m talking about Hermann, the novel&#39;s protagonist. In his characteristic metafiction, Nabokov has created the prototype (<em>Despair</em> was one of his earlier novels) of some of his more famous characters Humbert (<em>Lolita)</em> and Kinbote (<em>Pale Fire)</em> – egomaniacs whose shortcomings must be judged by the reader between the lines. I can&#39;t really be original in pointing out that Hermann is a pathetic dual of Raskolnikov from <em>Crime and Punishment</em> , because Hermann himself points it out in passing.</p>
<p>The first half of this book was somewhat dry, as I found with <em>Lolita</em> and to some extent the prose portion of <em>Pale Fire</em> . But the raw creativity and intelligence of the book really hit me in the second half. I don&#39;t like to use the word &#39;genius&#39; lightly, but I seem never to be able to reserve it when it comes to Nabokov. One thing that bothers me is that I can&#39;t tell at many stages whether it&#39;s Nabokov or Hermann speaking, especially with the sharp parodies that Hermann/Nabokov makes about popular literature, but perhaps this is what contributes to the wonderful subtlety and complexity of the novel.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought I had read all of the Vonnegut novels, but it seems that I’ve missed a couple. <em>Hocus Pocus</em> is characteristic Vonnegut – it’s like a slightly more light-hearted version of <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> , but for the Vietnam War instead of WW2: scathing criticism of the American Government (and I suppose humanity overall) enfolded in Vonnegut’s dry humour.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about Vonnegut is the very subtle and often inconsistent links between different novels. For example, a recurring ‘thing’ (can’t really call it a motif) is deeply thought-provoking science fiction stories hidden within pornographic magazines by the fictional author Kilgore Trout. The story here is called <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Tralfadamore</em> (the same planet that features in <em>Slaughterhouse</em> ), and posits that in a quest to develop a life-form that could spread among the stars, the Elders simply helped humanity learn about physics and chemistry – the ensuing carnage of the weaponised World Wars would be perfect for evolving germs resistant to the dangers of space.</p>
<p>There are many people out there who liked <em>Slaughterhouse</em> , but could never appreciate the rest of Vonnegut’s novels. <em>Hocus Pocus</em> might be a good gateway!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t enjoy this book at all – it was a deeply uncomfortable read. But this is one of the book&#39;s merits (much like Kafka&#39;s <em>Metamorphosis</em> ). Hamsun draws you into the maniacal thought processes of the starved protagonist, tugging on every little conflicting string of the character&#39;s psyche. It is a Dostoevskian kind of analysis, and the unnamed protagonist strongly reminds me of Raskolnikov from <em>Crime and Punishment</em>: desperate for money, but more desperate to give money away, resulting in an increasingly desperate protagonist and reader.</p>
<p>In a way, Hamsun’s protagonist is the precursor to Camus’ absurd hero Mersault (<a href="/?books=the-stranger" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Stranger</a>). He seeks the artistry of suffering, but unlike Mersault, fails to reach a conclusion. Perhaps the unknowing embodiment of absurdity is the ultimate artistry?</p>

<p>Autumn had arrived, that lovely, cool time of year when everything turns color and dies.</p>

<p>The thought of God began to occupy me again. It seemed to me quite inexcusable for him to meddle every time I applied for a job and thus upset everything, since all I was asking for was my daily bread.</p>

<p>God sat up in his heaven keeping a watchful eye on me, making sure that my destruction took place according to all the rules of the game, slowly and steadily, with no letup. But in the pit of hell the devils were raising their hackles in fury because it was taking me such a long time to commit a cardinal sin, an unforgivable sin for which God in his righteousness had to cast me down.</p>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Inferno by Dante Alighieri]]></title>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deeply considered schema of sin, though often allegorical for petty political feuds]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most people think that Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> is just a description of Hell and the punishments therein, through the eyes of a pious and judgmental Christian. This is <em>technically</em> correct, but it’s like saying that <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is about some guys looking for a powerful ring. Such a reductive take completely misses the point.</p>
<p>Dante instead paints a very nuanced (and often surprising) picture of sin and its consequences. While he was a devout Christian (and I suppose it’s fair to call him a judgmental one at that), he is not one for blind faith. Dante’s whole conception of the Divine order is based on his central perspective that rationality is humanity’s jewel. This is not unlike Aquinas, who believed that reason was a path to Divine “truth” (interestingly, Aquinas predates Dante by a few decades). Accordingly, sins that abuse the power of rationality (especially sins of deceit) are treated far more severely. This is somewhat reflected in Dante’s surprising choice of Virgil, a pagan, as his guide. While it might be an oversimplification to say that Virgil represents rationality, Virgil is portrayed as an ever-wise &#39;spirit level&#39; (ha ha).</p>
<p>An important piece of historical context is that Dante was exiled from Florence – at times, <em>Inferno</em> feels surprisingly political for what is ostensibly a book on theology. Dante spends several cantos describing the punishments given to various of his political enemies, and it honestly feels petty and vindictive.</p>
<p>By contrast, there are some cantos that are hugely ambitious and utterly fascinating – for example, when Dante judges classical characters such as Ulysses (Odysseus). I was surprised to find Ulysses in such a deep pocket of Hell, but it’s consistent with Dante’s view that the abuse of rationality/intellect (e.g the Trojan horse) is a despicable corruption of humanity’s greatest gift. That said, this might be explained by the fact that Ulysses was painted as a lot more deceitful and devious in the Aeneid (which Dante read), rather than cunning and intelligent as in the Iliad (which Dante did not read).</p>
<p>The final encounter with Lucifer, which is meant to be the climax of the book, is really anything but. This is part of Dante’s genius – in his well-reasoned perspective, sin is nothing but an absence of Divine love. Lucifer is portrayed as a stupid, ugly and mechanical being. His three heads make for a comic parody of the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Inferno</em> is drier than one might expect and oftentimes quite hard to get through. I do think it’s worth reading, but one must be prepared for a stream of political and social references that will fly over one’s head. I wish I could have experienced the terza rima in the original Italian. I read a version with the Italian printed on every other page, and there really is some melodious magic to reading it out loud (I could only understand a fraction of it, thanks to IB spanish!)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Historical Context</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante’s bitterness int he face of exile from Florence is one of his main motivators</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">At the time the Guelphs (supporting the Papacy) and the Ghibellines (supporting the Holy Roman Empire) were in constant conflict. Dante was a firm Ghibelline, and was definitely not a fan of Pope Boniface.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante feels that Florence has become too mercantile, he refers to the new unified currency as the ‘<em>maladetto fiore’</em> (accursed flower).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante’s love for Beatrice, who died when she was 24.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dante’s fundamentals</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">A charitable love, compared to the overpowering love discussed by some of his contemporaries like Cavalcanti.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">In his view, having one emperor avoids <em>cupidita</em> (avarice/greed).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">A believer in rationalism, but a rationalism that supports Christian faith. Development from the Aristotlean logic that Aquinas renewed a few years earlier.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">To some extent, obsessed with the idea of Rome, thinking about it as the idealised Empire. This may be why he chose the pagan Virgil as his guide, rather than a Christian figure. He seems to remain wilfully ignorant of all of the bad aspects of the Roman empire.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante is an expert in nuance, in many aspects of life. In Inferno he carefully grades different sins. In his social life, he has made enemies of some people while holding their siblings in highest esteem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>La Commedia</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Made the decision to write the <em>Commedia</em> in Italian, rather than Latin. He has discussed this in some of the other works. He wants it to be ‘nutritious’ for the people reading it – something which Latin is not suited for.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Some similarity between the Commedia’s terza rima and Aristotle’s syllogistic logic</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Virgil is an unnatural choice of guide, but it is an emphasis that he wants Florence to return to the ethical and judicial standards of Rome. In some sense, he may be trying to anchor his work in the stage of political history. However, stylistically, Dante differs quite heavily from Virgil. Instead of the sombre narrative continuum that Virgil adopts in his epics, Dante writes in a more episodic manner, with much shorter cantos.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante is not just a spirit in Inferno, he is an actual body (in canto 12, he kicks a stone that leads to us seeing the Minotaur). The human body is very important to Dante, and he is not a cartesian dualist. Although rationality is fundamental, that rationality has to act through a physical medium (and experience the Earthly temptations!)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante, at the end of Inferno, is humble regarding his account of the Divine order. It is the impatience to name and understand that condemned Lucifer to fall: “through not waiting for the light, he fell unripe”.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante takes pleasure in asking ‘why’ – this culminates in <em>Paradiso</em> which is almost a ‘game’ of some sorts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inferno</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Often quite dry, because of excessive descriptions of Dante&#39;s contemporaries. However, he has a very fine moral sense and literary skill. Consigning Ulysses to a rather deep pocket of hell was a very interesting move.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Rationality above all</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Dante has come very close to committing some of the sins he has discussed.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The anticlimax of Satan and the contrasts to the trinity</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magical realist exploration of fate – the iconic Murakami novel]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/?books=sputnik-sweetheart" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Sputnik Sweetheart</a> marked a turning point in my view of Murakami; it made me set aside my previous reservations and explore more of his work.</p>
<p><em>Kafka on the Shore</em> retains Murakami’s signature “weirdness” but is also a genuinely engaging mystery, full of subtle layers for readers who pay close attention. It stands out as a strong example of magical realism, evoking the style of contemporary Márquez.</p>
<p>Fate is one of the novel’s key themes, which explains the prominent Oedipal imagery (and at times, more than just imagery). While this can make parts of the novel uncomfortable, it effectively conveys Kafka’s struggle with his father’s prophecy – a reminder that the fault lies not in our stars but in ourselves. I also appreciate how Murakami explores Time: not only is it central to the plot, but it’s also deeply embedded in the novel’s structure.</p>
<p>Some aspects of the novel still puzzle me, like the occasional shifts from third-person to second-person narration, but given its complexity, I’m inclined to trust that Murakami had a purpose. The fault is not in the novel but in myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>&quot;Kafka, in everybody&#39;s life there&#39;s a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can&#39;t go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That&#39;s how we survive.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>People are drawn deeper into tragedy not by their defects but by their virtues.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In a place where time isn&#39;t important, neither is memory.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The struggle of the “thinking and feeling heart” in dealing with societal sea changes]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Japanese is a very expressive language, containing many words without direct English translations. A famous example, most likely popularised by Tumblr, is <em>komorebi</em> (sunlight filtering through trees). “Kokoro” is another word that is hard to translate:</p>
<p>The novel, a classic in Japan, presents the relationship between a young man and Sensei. However, underlying the relatively simple plot is the strong symbolism of the fading Meiji era and the subsequent internationalisation of Japan (a recurring theme in much of 20th-century Japanese literature). While this shift was viewed positively by many, it left the older generation grappling with feelings of guilt, embodied in the “thinking and feeling heart” that <em>Kokoro</em> captures so well. But even without this deeper historical context, <em>Kokoro</em> stands as a powerful and tragic novel that deepened my appreciation of Japanese culture.</p>
<hr>
<p>Kokoro, the novel’s title, is a complex and important word that can perhaps best be explained as “the thinking and feeling heart,” as distinguished from the workings of the pure intellect, devoid of human feeling.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“I finally couldn’t stand it anymore and said to him, ‘If there’s any fault in me, then please tell me honestly. If I can correct it, I will.’ And he replied, ‘You don’t have any fault. The fault is in me.’ When I heard that, it made me unbearably sad. It made me cry. And I longed more than ever to know how I might be to blame.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Woman that she was, my mother’s reasoning grew rather incoherent at such times, though when it came to talking, she could easily outdo my father and me combined.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>a commonplace idea stated with passionate conviction carries more living truth than some novel observation expressed with cool indifference.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In my heart, though, I was saddened that the person I loved and trusted most in the world could not understand me. But it’s within your power to help her understand, I thought, and yet you’re too cowardly to do so, and I grew still sadder.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can understand why so many people didn’t like the book: I picked it up expecting an interesting discussion about quantitative modelling, its drawbacks, etc – a fair expectation given the author’s other book <em>My Life as a Quant</em> – but only the last third of the book conforms to that expectation. It’s valuable to clarify the distinction between a model and a theory and to set the issue in its philosophical context, but I think that Derman takes it a little bit too far with the Judaic traditions and Spinoza’s ethics (the latter of which takes up a good chunk of the book). The anecdotes often have a tangential (at best) relation to the underlying theme of the book, and it seems like a case of the editors not standing up to the author.</p>
<p>However, the last third of the book is very good – a great discussion on typical failures (especially when physicists try their hand at finance), and how there needs to be a philosophical sea change for there to be progress. He likens some of the models in finance to the Greek tale of Pygmalion: a sculptor who creates a statue of a woman so beautiful that he falls in love with it (except in the real world there’s no Aphrodite to make the model come to life). And I can’t resist the little digs at the social sciences:</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>The United Sates has suffered […] taxpayer-funded bailouts of large capitalist corporations; crony capitalism; private profits and public losses; companies that shorted stock for a living being legally protected from the shorting of their own stock; compromised yet unpunished ratings agencies; government policies that tried to cure insolvency by branding it as illiquidity.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>We have all committed acts that surprise us and are hard to forgive. You can count yourself lucky if your model of yourself survives collision with time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When someone proposes a theorem “Why?” is less important. A model is the construction of an analogy. A theory is the linking of the outer with the inner.</p>
<p><em>Phenomenology rather than theory</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Pygmalion: a statue of a woman so beautiful that he fill in love with it. This is not an uncommon occurrence in the world of finance.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Soon I began to believe it was possible to apply the methods of physics successfully to economcics and finance, perhaps even to build a grand unified theory of securities. After twenty years on Wall Street I’m a disbeliever.** ****The similarity between physics and finance lies more in their syntax than their semantics.**</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Converting their failed attempts at systematic stock price prediction into a fundamental postulate of their field was a fiendishly clever jujitsu response on the part of economists [in reference to the EMH].</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Physics models begin with the current state of the world and evolve it into the future. Financial models begin with current perceptions about the future and use them to move back into the present to estimate current values”.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memory palaces are effective]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> is an autobiographical wrapper around the method of loci, i.e. memory palaces (popularised in BBC’s <em>Sherlock</em> ). We follow the inspirational (if clichéd) transformation of the author – from an ’ordinary journalist’ to a World Memory champion, just by using simple memory techniques. That may sound like clickbait, but the method of loci has been around for thousands of years. Supposedly, the phrase “in the first place” is a linguistic artefact of how orators would use the method of loci to remember speeches.</p>
<p>At a high level, the method of loci involves the attachment of pieces of information to locations – people tend to have far better visuospatial memory than verbal memory, possibly as a result of our need to navigate the Savannahs.</p>
<p>I went through a mind palaces phase, so can attest firsthand that they can dramatically improve recall. There are things that I put into a mind palace in 2016 that I can still clearly see (despite visiting the mind palace very infrequently). This brings me to the catch. Mind palaces aren’t a free lunch: a huge amount of mental effort and creativity are required to generate and ‘visit’ the imagery (which must be vivid and flashy by design). As the author notes, this can leave you a little bit wearied. But as I said, I’ve personally been able to retain the information without ‘visiting’ the images too often, so perhaps the initial input of mental effort is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>Although the book is a little bit unfocused, jumping from biography to discussion of the method of loci to interviews with people like Tony Buzan (surprisingly unpleasant!), some of the tangents are well worth the time.</p>
<p>I would recommend this book to anyone who is unfamiliar with the method of loci – if you haven’t tried it before, it’s worth giving it a go! Most likely you’ll realise that it’s difficult and possibly not worth the effort, but there’s a small chance that it’ll be a game-changer. Although I was familiar with mind palaces, I guess this book has reminded me of their power, so I will probably be doing some mental renovations in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The best way to get out of the autonomous stage and off the OK plateau, Ericsson has found, is to actually practice failing. One way to do that is to put yourself in the mind of someone far more competent at the task you’re trying to master, and try to figure out how that person works through problems.</p>

<p>top achievers tend to follow the same general pattern of development. They develop strategies for consciously keeping out of the autonomous stage while they practice by doing three things: focusing on their technique, staying goal-oriented, and getting constant and immediate feedback on their performance.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Narconomics</em> is an insightful and entertaining book which analyses the South American drug trade from an economic perspective, treating cartels as complex multinational corporations. When framed this way, it is clear that cartels have to deal with the same problems as other big companies: unhappy workers, public opinion, competition, diversification etc.</p>
<p><em>Narconomics</em> is rightly critical of current government efforts to combat drugs. For example, their main approach is to target the supply side such that price increases (so hopefully demand decreases). This fails on two counts - drug demand is quite inelastic, but in any case targeting supply doesn’t seem to affect the price: the cartels just push the burden onto the farmers who are already living on pennies.</p>
<p>Super interesting stuff, and a quick read.</p>

<p>no analyst of the beef industry would calculate the price of a live steer mooching around on the Argentine pampa using restaurant data from New York City. Yet this is effectively how the value of heroin seized in Afghanistan [is valued]</p>

<p>there is an overwhelming focus on suppressing the supply side of the business, when basic economics suggests that addressing demand would make more sense. Cutting supply has done more to raise prices than it has to reduce the amount of drugs consumed, resulting in a more valuable criminal market.</p>

<p>In sum, by trebling the price of cocaine’s raw ingredient in South America—something no policy has yet gotten close to achieving—the best-case scenario is that cocaine’s retail price in the United States would rise by 0.6 percent. This does not seem like a good return on the billions of dollars invested in disrupting the supply of leaves in the Andes.</p>

<p>Governments are approaching the cocaine market as if it were the chocolate market, in which a rise in the price of cocoa beans leads to a corresponding rise in the price of chocolate bars. In reality, it is more like the art market, in which the tiny cost of the raw materials is insignificant compared with the high price of the finished product. Attempts to raise the price of cocaine by forcing up the cost of coca leaves is a bit like trying to drive up the price of art by raising the cost of paint.</p>

<p>whereas Mexican gangbangers are highly footloose, liable to change sides to work for whichever cartel seems to be stronger or higher paying, the labor market for Salvadoran mareros is completely illiquid.

<p>Herschel Grossman, an American economist, created a model of mafia-provided public services and found that in some cases, competition between the state and the mob could result in public services that were better than those offered when the state alone provided them.</p>

<p>For criminals looking for an offshore base in the Americas, Guatemala has a lot to offer. But it faces stiff competition from its southern neighbor, Honduras.

        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=positioning</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=positioning"/>
        <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Positioning</em> is quite an old book, and its age does show (at the time of writing, cable TV was the next big thing). So it’s hard to judge the extent to which the lessons of the book are still applicable because internet advertising has obviously changed things a lot.</p>
<p>However, I think the core ideas of <em>Positioning</em> are relatively timeless in the field of marketing. The main takeaway is that positioning should guide the entire market strategy: it is not some minor technique you can apply to try to improve your results, it is the only way of making your product stand out in a world where customers are deluged by choice.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by the suggestion that it is rarely a good idea to try to become the market leader if you’re not one already, because their position is likely strongly ingrained. You need to “climb the positioning ladder” one step at a time, focusing on getting to second place first, then biding your time before a strike at first. This is why positional thinking is still underused – it requires compromise and modesty. You will have to sacrifice some of your market share in order to build your position (the example he uses is Nyquil – paracetamol which marketed itself for night time only).</p>
<hr>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Positioning theory</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Positioning is thinking in reverse. Instead of starting with yourself, you start with the mind of the prospect. Instead of asking what you are, you ask what position you already own in the mind of the prospect.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The essence of positioning is sacrifice. You must be willing to give up something in order to establish that unique position.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This is the classic mistake made by the leader. The illusion that the power of the product is derived from the power of the organization. It’s just the reverse. The power of the organization is derived from the power of the product, the position that the product owns in the prospect’s mind.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you try to be all things to all people, you wind up with nothing. Better to narrow the focus of your expertise. To establish a unique position as a specialist, not as a jack-of-all-trades generalist.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>With rare exceptions, a company should almost never change its basic positioning strategy. Only its tactics, those short-term maneuvers that are intended to implement a longterm strategy.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>That’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to tell the prospect what the product is not, rather than what it is. The first automobile, for example, was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to position the concept against the existing mode of transportation.</p>
<p><em>Via negativa</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Competition</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>To win the battle for the mind, you can’t compete head-on against a company that has a strong, established position. You can go around, under or over, but never head to head. The leader owns the high ground. The No. 1 position in the prospect’s mind. The top rung of the product ladder. To move up the ladder, you must follow the rules of positioning. In our overcommunicated society, the name of the game today is positioning</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“We’re better than our competitors” isn’t repositioning. It’s comparative advertising and not very effective.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>people sometimes expect too much of an idea. They want one that is not only great, but one that everyone else thinks is great too. There are no such ideas. If you wait until an idea is ready to be accepted, it’s too late. Someone else will have preempted it.</p>
<p><em>It will always feel uncomfortable</em></p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Naming</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Shakespeare was wrong. A rose by any other name would not smell as sweet.</p>

<p>When you have a generic brand name, you can afford to ignore the brand and promote the category.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In a physical sense, the name is also like the point of a knife. It opens up the mind to let the message penetrate. With the right name, the product fills the creneau and stays there.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Line-extension names are forgettable because they have no independent position in the mind. They are satellites to the original brand name. Their only contribution is to blur the position occupied by the original name. Often with catastrophic results.</p>
<p>a word has no meaning until someone uses it and fills it with meaning.</p>
<p><em>Jeff Lawson (Twilio CEO) recommends using a brand new word for a brand name – you get to completely shape its meaning</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There is only negative equity in a bad name. When the name is bad, things tend to get worse. When the name is good, things tend to get better.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>The essence of a good positioning strategy is that it transcends every aspect of a company. You know you have a winner when you run it up the corporate flagpole and everybody salutes.</p>

<p>The truth is, the road to fame and fortune is rarely found within yourself. The only sure way to success is to find yourself a horse to ride. It may be difficult for the ego to accept, but success in life is based more on what others can do for you than on what you can do for yourself.</p>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima]]></title>
        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=spring-snow</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=spring-snow"/>
        <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Spring Snow</em> is a subdued masterpiece. It doesn&#39;t feel very much like any of the other Japanese novels I’ve read. Mishima doesn’t rely on linguistic austerity like Murakami, and doesn’t need to try hard to create the bleak existentialist mood that permeates many Japanese works. In fact, <em>Spring Snow</em> for the most part feels very Western, which is fitting, because one of the main thematic undercurrents is the influence of westernisation in Meiji’s Japan. I am again struck by how much Japan’s cultural identity is related to its recent history, particularly the forceful transition from the Tokugawa Shogunate to the Meiji Empire. This seems to be an overarching backdrop to many of the Japanese novels that I have read (see <a href="/?books=kokoro" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Kokoro</a>) – <em>Spring Snow</em> is no exception.</p>
<p>The novel itself is a rather tragic story of an intelligent, cultured, and attractive young man named Kiyoaki, and his affair with his beautiful childhood friend Satoko. It is not, however, a romance novel. I can’t exactly say what it is, but I know that it is lyrical, thoughtful, philosophical at times, but always brimming with beautiful melancholy.</p>
<hr>
<p>don’t you think that would be marvelous? To take your own ideal and bend the world to it</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Having gained the moon, how much then would he dread life in a world without it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He could say: “No, let’s not go back.” But to do that was to reach out and pick up the dice. And his unskilled hand would have frozen at the very touch of them. He was not ready.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Those who lack imagination have no choice but to base their conclusions on the reality they see around them. But on the other hand, those who are imaginative have a tendency to build fortified castles they have designed themselves, and to seal off every window in them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Every show of feeling was now governed with a marvelous economy. If a candle has burned brilliantly but now stands alone in the dark with its flame extinguished, it need no longer fear that its substance will dissolve into hot wax.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt that he’s heading straight for tragedy. It will be beautiful, of course, but should he throw his whole life away as a sacrificial offering to such a fleeting beauty—like a bird in flight glimpsed from a window?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I’ve known supreme happiness, and I’m not greedy enough to want what I have to go on forever. Every dream ends. Wouldn’t it be foolish, knowing that nothing lasts forever, to insist that one has a right to do something that does?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The path we’re taking is not a road, Kiyo, it’s a pier, and it ends someplace where the sea begins. It can’t be helped.”</p>
<p><em>Beautiful acceptance of finiteness.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Just let matters slide. How much better to accept each sweet drop of the honey that was Time, than to stoop to the vulgarity latent in every decision. However grave the matter at hand might be, if one neglected it for long enough, the act of neglect itself would begin to affect the situation, and someone else would emerge as an ally.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think I may have misunderstood Murakami. My notes on <em>Norwegian Wood</em> include the fantastically militant line: “he’s just trying to appeal to a semi-literate hipster audience”. So either I was wrong then, or I have joined the semi-literate hipster circle because I am starting to really enjoy Murakami.</p>
<p><em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em> is written from the point of view of an introverted, intelligent young man who recounts the story of his friend Sumire and her relationship with Miu, an attractive older woman. Something happens to Sumire, and the narrator’s subsequent investigations are the heart of the novel. However, as is Murakami’s way, the turn of events is not exactly logical. Thus at the climax of the novel, the Ferris wheel scene, I was tempted to scoff and say “typical Murakami” – a completely unpredictable and perhaps even ridiculous twist.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make any sense, at all. Every potential resolution in the plot leads to another unanswered/unanswerable question. This is what I experienced with <em>After Dark</em> and <em>Norwegian Wood</em> – extremely engaging reads which ultimately left me unsatisfied because of the lack of a denouement. But I am beginning to appreciate the artistry underlying this indeterminacy. There is value in the somewhat arbitrary turns of events, a value increased by the undecidable nature of some of the questions put forward by Murakami.</p>
<hr>
<p>It made her think of Laika, the dog. The man-made satellite streaking soundlessly across the blackness of outer space. The dark, lustrous eyes of the dog gazing out the tiny window. In the infinite loneliness of space, what could the dog possibly be looking at?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits. From far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they’re nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The core goal of <em>Street Fighting Mathematics</em> is to help the reader make back-of-the-envelope approximations using techniques like dimensional analysis. In other words, it’s a written reference for the kind of simple mathematical tools that physicists end up being quite good at.</p>
<p>The first few chapters, which outline dimensional analysis, are indeed useful and interesting. But it quickly goes downhill as the author tries to find enough content to fill a textbook with. There are many examples where the author obviously sticks a rabbit into a hat (”1/4 is close enough to 1/2pi”) then expects you to be impressed when the rabbit pops out later (&quot;our answer is, in fact, exact!!!!&quot;). In essence, this book will teach you the art of reverse-engineered hand-wavy solutions.</p>
<p>If you’ve studied university physics, this will be a poor re-telling of things that are second nature to you. Otherwise, it’s worth reading the first few chapters but quickly putting the book away after that.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had <em>extremely</em> low expectations for this book, but it’s actually a rather good overview of some nice mathematical techniques that may be applicable in business. It covers the surface of quite a wide range of important topics, such as statistics, decision analysis using game theory, time series analysis, and a rough overview of quantitative methods in financial markets.</p>
<p>Of course, not much explanation or detail is provided, but it&#39;s often useful to have a non-technical survey before you decide what merits further study. One of the things that I found most interesting was using Network Analysis to plan big projects – essentially, you construct directed acyclic graphs of all the tasks so you know what to prioritise.</p>
<p>Not a bad book to flick through during a commute!</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-mis-behavior-of-markets"/>
        <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mandelbrot is primarily known for his contributions to fractal geometry and his eponymous Mandelbrot set, but as it happens, he was also a talented physicist and economist. I wasn’t expecting too much from this book, perhaps the stereotypical arrogant physicist trying to apply something he learnt in his lecture room to make money on the markets. But it doesn’t seem that Mandelbrot went out of his way to apply fractals to finance, it’s just that he saw that fractals could explain the largest body of facts with the fewest number of assumptions – the general goal of a scientific theory.</p>
<p>His scientific perspective on markets was delightfully refreshing: instead of a million shades of grey, Mandelbrot simply delineates a lot of claims into either ‘true’, ‘plausible’, or ‘false’. And it is both entertaining and enlightening to see how much of standard financial theory he dumps in the last category. The first give chapters are a lucid refresher of the tenets of academic finance (CAPM, random walks etc), after which he systematically demolishes the underlying assumptions. He then proposes his alternatives, which are logically accountable – every step and assumption can be scrutinised.</p>
<p>I think the book is best read after being indoctrinated (as I had been) by the Efficient Markets Hypothesis and its supporters. <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em> was the first book that changed the way I thought about finance; I suppose you could call it a financial paradigm shift (in the spirit of Kuhn). <em>The Misbehaviour of Markets</em> must be the second. When people ask me for stock advice (it happens…) I normally revert to “stick your money in an ETF’”(while caveating that it’s not financial advice, of course). Certainly not a terrible suggestion, but in light of this book, it is not the be-all and end-all as I once thought it to be. There are opportunities for money to be made, perhaps in compensation for risks far greater than what traditional theory acknowledges.</p>
<p>In any case, notwithstanding my prosaic description, the book is a very good read. Mandelbrot writes well, with just the right amount of personal interludes (he is an interesting character!). He reminds me, in a way, of Richard Feynman. Honest, logical, and unwilling to follow doctrine if there is logical evidence against it – confident in what he knows to be wrong, but humble and self-critical in what he proposes to be true. An embodiment of the spirit of science.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>The odds of financial ruin in a free, global-market economy have been grossly underestimated. In this sense, the common man is wise in his prejudice that—especially after the collapse of the Internet bubble—markets are risky. But financial theorists are not so wise.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Warren E. Buffett, the famously successful investor and industrialist, jested that he would like to fund university chairs in the Efficient Market Hypothesis, so that the professors would train even more misguided financiers whose money he could win.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>to be able to imitate reality is a form of understanding,</p>
<p><em>The importance of realistic simulations</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A sculptor, when modeling in stone or clay, does not try to clone Nature; he highlights some things, ignores others, idealizes or abstracts some more, to achieve an effect. Different sculptors will seek different effects. Likewise, a scientist must necessarily pick and choose among various aspects of reality to incorporate into a model.</p>
<p><em>Modelling cannot be free from human bias – almost by definition. Otherwise who would be doing the modelling?</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>according to Pareto’s formula, the conditional probability of making a billion dollars once you have made half a billion is the same as that of making a million once you have made half a million. Money begets money, power makes power.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the Efficient Market Hypothesis is no more than that, a hypothesis. Many a grand theory has died under the onslaught of real data.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Our alien, seeing a planet obsessed by so illogical a system, quickly decamps. But his observation of two forms of wildness remain: abrupt change, and almost-trends. These are the two basic facts of a financial market, the facts that any model must accommodate.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Until the study of finance advances, for the how and why we will each have to look to our own imaginations. ...</p>
<p><em>For now we have to settle with phenomenology</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>there is no puzzle to the equity premium. Real investors know better than the economists. They instinctively realize that the market is very, very risky, riskier than the standard models say.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But the turbulent markets of the past few decades should have taught us, at the least, that value is a slippery concept, and one whose usefulness is vastly over-rated.</p>

        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-noise-of-time</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-noise-of-time"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time”]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Noise of Time</em> is a tragic historical fiction novel about the peculiar genius Shostakovich, who was undoubtedly talented, though not enough to pass unscathed through Russia’s tumultuous early 20th century. It captures his incessant, yet justified, fear in the face of Power – tyrants like Stalin, and arguably Khrushchev – who never saw the value of music beyond its use in controlling people.</p>
<p>Shostakovich himself, or at least the novel’s portrayal of him, reminds me in some ways of Dostoevsky’s Raskolnikov, minus the homicidal tendencies; constantly questioning his own courage and ultimately disappointing himself. He is quite a charming character (irrespective of his musical genius), and one can only imagine the artistic heights he might have reached had he been free to compose as he pleased. All he wanted to do was make music, but this was never enough. He had to endure public humiliation and censorship, and maybe worse, he was forced to become something he wasn’t. The thematic culmination of the novel is the following observation:</p>
<p>At times, the novel is slightly self-conscious – Julian Barnes gets a bit too carried away with trying to philosophise on art and music, with the Shostakovich of the novel sometimes acting as a mouthpiece for Barnes. However, given the eloquence of his arguments and the stunning clarity of his conclusions, this is forgivable. <em>The Noise of Time</em> touches on politics, history, and philosophy – masterfully wrapped in a heartfelt yet melancholic package.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Nothing begins just like that, on a certain date at a certain place. It all began in many places, and at many times, some even before you were born, in foreign countries, and in the minds of others.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He was an introverted man who was attracted to extroverted women. Was that part of the trouble?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He had ended the symphony fortissimo and in the major. What if he has ended it pianissimo and in the minor? On such things might a life - might several lives - turn.</p>
<p><em>I am fascinated by the idea of Khrushchev and other Soviet administrators listening to classic music to judge whether it is sufficiently Soviet.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When truth-speaking became impossible - because it led to immediate death - it had to be disguised. In Jewish folk music, despair is disguised as dance. And so, truth’s disguise was irony. Because the tyrants ear is rarely tuned to hear it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The natural progression of human life is from optimism to pessimism; and a sense of irony helps temper pessimism, helps produce balance, harmony.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Music is immortal, music will always last and always be needed, music can say anything, music ... and so on. he stopped his ears while they explained to him the nature of his own art. He applauded their idealism. And yes, music might be immortal, but composers alas are not. They are easily silenced, and even more easily killed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If you turned your back on irony, it curdled into sarcasm. And what good was it then? Sarcasm was irony which had lost its soul.</p>
<p><em>There is a difference between wit and sarcasm!</em></p>

        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-nuremberg-trials</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-nuremberg-trials"/>
        <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am deeply fascinated by the idea of the Nuremberg Trials, and have been for quite a while. Can humans overcome their need for vengeance to give a fair trial to the defeated enemies, some of whom seem downright monstrous? Is ‘war crime’ an oxymoron? Does hate speech warrant the death penalty?</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that out of the four Allied powers, only America pushed for a fair trial – Britain, France and Russia wanted summary executions, or at most show trials. To America’s credit, they insisted on a respectable trial with a firm legal basis. Whether their motives were completely pure (which the authors doubt) doesn’t matter to me. Even the defendants were humbled by the American emphasis on a fair trial, which of course was a courtesy seldom given by the defendants to their prisoners.</p>
<p>I liked the rich descriptions of the defendants and prosecutors: it reminds you that all of these characters were all human (despicable as some of them were). This was reassuring in some cases (seeing the prosecutors’ and certain judges’ commitment to the truth), and horrifying when it came to people like Kaltenbrunner and Goering. The book is balanced enough for the reader to find themself rooting for some of the defendants, like Hjalmar Schacht, the president of the Reichsbank, who was later sent to the concentration camps for his participation in a Hitler assassination attempt (he was later acquitted on all counts).</p>
<p>It was a bit disappointing in the end to see how politics influenced their sentences given by the judges. It was almost like a bidding war: the Russians wanted a death penalty, the French wanted 10 years, and they had to meet somewhere in the middle. The American Judge suggested an unnecessarily harsh punishment for one of the defendants just as a power play with the Russian representative, which is somewhat repulsive. One of the bizarre parts of the book is when the authors point out that nobody could really justify Admiral Doenitz’s 10-year sentence (even the judges), but sentenced he was. Nevertheless, the judges overall seem to have realised that they were basically defining the new field of international law, and acted with commensurate dignity and fairness.</p>
<p>Although the book is long and detailed, and perhaps a bit slow at some stages, I seldom found it to be dry. On the contrary, the text is full of wit:</p>
<p>This book represents what I think the study of history should be like: it offers a balanced and nuanced perspective on genuinely interesting events that have shaped the world.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>Did an international court have the right to examine a state’s treatment of its own citizens, however vile? The judges dodged a decision and instead rested their verdicts on crimes committed by Nazi forces in occupied territories.</p>
<p><em>A great example of just how groundbreaking the Trials were – International Law was a nascent area.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It has to prove that victors can so rise above the ordinary limitations of human nature as to be able to try fairly the foes they vanquished, by submitting themselves to the restraints of law</p>
<p><em>Something that few victors have done in the past.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This committee considered adding a further charge – that of causing the war itself – but they could not agree whether causing war was actually a crime in international law.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When discussing policy on official occasions Stalin always recommended that war criminals be given a judicial hearing before (inevitably) being shot.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If you are determined to execute a man in any case, there is no occasion for a trial; the world yields no respect to courts that are merely organized to convict.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The vast bulk of the archives remained undamaged – largely due ‘to the lack of understanding on the part of those who issued the orders of the professional psychology of archivists, who would rather eviscerate their own children than destroy the material entrusted to their charge.’</p>
<p><em>Don’t mess with archivists and librarians!</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Russians asked for a twelve day delay, their avowed reason being that their chief prosecutor, Rudenko, had malaria. As a Foreign Office official saw it, it was ‘malaria of the diplomatic variety’ – the plain truth was that the Russian case was not ready.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgement of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason.’</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>[One] cannot subscribe to the perverted reasoning that society may advance and strengthen the rule of law by the expenditure of morally innocent lives but that progress in law may never be made at the price of morally guilty lives.’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>An unequalled depth of cynicism was touched by the authorities at Mauthausen in their official report for one day in March 1945 which noted that 203 people had died, at regular intervals, all of heart attacks and in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><em>There’s some incredibly dark comedy in this – see Ianucci’s ‘The Death of Stalin’.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Frank was a lapsed Old Catholic who announced his conversion to Roman Catholicism in prison. This conversion had resulted in a state of abject penitence which was not always theologically distinguishable from maudlin self-pity.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>it became clear that Kesselring was, in Dean’s words, ‘a decent man according to his own standards’ but that ‘his standards were those of a murderer and a liar whenever any German military advantage could be gained.’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘a man who commits crimes cannot plead as a defence that he committed them in uniform.’</p>
<p>...</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quest for individualism in the Jazz Age]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This Side of Paradise</em> , one of Fitzgerald’s first novels, is a charming coming-of-age story that follows Amory, a thinly veiled Fitzgerald, as he navigates the shifting challenges of growing up in the Jazz Age.</p>
<p>One of the central themes is individualism: whether any of these characters can truly separate themselves from their surroundings. The novel offers a pessimistic view. Amory constantly questions whether his epigrams are truly insightful or merely recycled ideas masquerading as wisdom – by the end, he renounces them altogether. The novel suggests that no individual can escape the influence of their time. Eleanor, for instance, remarks that if she had been born 100 years later, she would have been able to better use her intellect instead of just searching for a suitor. Similarly, nobody from Amory’s generation can avoid the war, and Amory laments how it has crushed true individuality. The novel concludes with a socialist manifesto, yet one that remains optimistic about human progress.</p>
<p>The traditional coming-of-age realisations are handled well, such as when Amory recognises how difficult it is to be truly exceptional:</p>
<p>He also grapples with the tension between romanticism and practicality:</p>
<p>Though the plot is fairly conventional, the writing is engaging and at times experimental, with some chapters shifting from prose to drama. What the novel lacks in polish, it makes up for with dry humour and charm. In this way, it stands as an interesting contrast to Fitzgerald’s later work, like <em>Gatsby.</em></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is a rage against the second law of thermodynamics]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Schrödinger’s contributions to physics are beyond question – he gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum objects. But physicists often have a spotty track-record of applying physics to other domains. I thus approached <em>What is Life</em> with a healthy skepticism.</p>
<p>But throughout the book, Schrödinger’s humility comes through strongly – a rare trait for physicists when discussing biology. His application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology, while highlighting uncharted territory.</p>
<p>As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems. His answer: the highly ordered biological processes require a certain stability that does not exist at smaller scales. However, we can’t just apply classical statistical physics and hope for the best because the parts that make a difference are actually small enough where quantum effects might make a difference – combined with the many biological feedback loops, this makes biology somewhat intractable from the physicist’s perspective.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? Schrodinger believes that life is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e. order) to stave off its own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have:</p>
<p>This is a wonderfully original perspective, and seems to be a useful model (though it raises interesting questions: to what extent is a computer alive?). On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s <em>The Last Question</em> again… the second law of thermodynamics is haunting.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key ideas</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The human body is, by necessity, many orders of magnitude larger than an atom. This is because such a highly ordered process requires a certain stability that does not exist at smaller realms. However, we can’t just apply statistical physics and hope for the best because the parts that make a difference are actually very small (small enough where quantum effects might make a difference).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Mutations must be sufficiently rare, otherwise evolution could not occur as any negative mutations would cancel out the effect of good mutations. This means that genes (large molecules) must have a certain resistance to isomeric change from ionising rays</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Life consumes negative entropy to delay the inevitable thermodynamic equilibrium (death). Interesting suggestion that there is some relation between body temperature and &#39;intensity of life’.<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Not sure this is rigorously a good definition, because by this analogy, fire (or a computer program) is alive</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">But it’s intuitively sensible</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>A scientist is supposed to have a complete and thorough knowledge, at first hand, of some subjects and, therefore, is usually expected not to write on any topic of which he is not a master. This is regarded as a matter of noblesse oblige.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>What is the characteristic feature of life? When is a piece of matter said to be alive? When it goes on &#39;doing something&#39;, moving, exchanging material with its environment, and so forth, and that for a much longer period than we would expect an inanimate piece of matter to &#39;keep going&#39; under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>What an organism feeds upon is negative entropy. Or, to put it less paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing while alive.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>an engineer, familiar with heat engines only, will, after inspecting the construction of an electric motor, be prepared to find it working along principles which he does not yet understand.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>An organism&#39;s astonishing gift of concentrating a &#39;stream of order&#39; on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos of &#39;drinking orderliness&#39; from a suitable environment seems to be connected with the presence of the &#39;aperiodic solids&#39;, the chromosome molecules, which doubtless represent the highest degree of well-ordered atomic association we know of much higher than the ordinary periodic crystal in virtue of the individual role every atom and every radical is playing here.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The story of LTCM reads like a Greek tragedy – specifically Oedipus Rex (minus the incest). It was a fund that had so much going for it: trading heavyweights, 1 billion in capital, and titans of financial mathematics (Nobel laureates Merton and Scholes). At the start, they were very successful, returning 50% annually and creating huge amounts of wealth. But nothing lasts forever. A perspective I liked was that these profits were really ‘borrowed against’ future losses – such is the nature of highly leveraged trading and negative-skew bets.</p>
<p>To paraphrase one commentator, you can analyse the greek letters (all of the mathematical terms in their models) as much as you want, but one Greek word not to forget about is <em>hubris</em> . Blinded by their success, LTCM started moving into strategies in which they had little expertise, thinking that their same models would work everywhere. They started making explicit directional bets on different markets, rather than sticking to their core arbitrage trades. In 1998, they were wiped out by the “black-swan” Russian debt crisis.</p>
<p>These are people who should have known better. There was serious evidence questioning the assumptions of the models at the time, but they traded all their chips as if there was not a chance that they could be wrong – completely ignoring the facts in exchange for elegant maths, and stacking on leverage and illiquidity risk.</p>
<p>I don’t think this story is damning for the field of quantitative finance as a whole, but it is a sobering reminder that markets are very difficult to model. An important counter-prescription:</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think the problem with <em>Cat’s Cradle</em> was that the first time I read it, I was expecting science fiction. So I judged it for being poor scifi – “ice-nine” is a fascinating idea (a crystal of ice that turns any water it touches into ice), but its implications are hardly explored. If you look on Goodreads, more than 2000 people have shelved this book as science fiction. This is hugely misleading. Having read almost all of Vonnegut’s novels, I can&#39;t stress enough that <em>Vonnegut isn’t a scifi writer</em> (though he occasionally draws on elements of scifi).</p>
<p>With this out of the way, <em>Cat&#39;s Cradle</em> is brilliant. Bokononism, the fictional religion which plays a huge part of the book, is strangely charming. And it really counterbalances the other main melody of the book, that of ice-nine. I wish there were a proper copy of <em>The Books of Bokonon</em> , and I too want to know who is in my <em>karass.</em></p>
<p><em>Cat’s Cradle</em> is not the weirdest of Vonnegut&#39;s books (<em>Breakfast of Champions</em> still takes the cake there), but it’s certainly quirky. I can’t say whether it&#39;s better or worse than <a href="/?books=the-sirens-of-titan" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Sirens of Titan</a> or <em>Slaughterhouse</em> , but these three works together are enough for me to count Vonnegut as one of my favourite authors.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Don Quixote</em> is a very surprising novel. Despite its important role in Western literature (and the fact that it was written over 400 years ago) – Cervantes is often considered to be “Spanish Shakespeare” – <em>Don Quixote</em> is readable and often hilarious, with a charming immaturity (plenty of “Tom and Jerry”-esque scatological humour).</p>
<p>Sancho Panza’s dry wit makes him the perfect foil to Quixote, allowing the delusions to become a mirror for reality. The metafiction felt a bit silly initially, but it becomes delightfully complex as the novel progresses – especially impressive given that the concept of metafiction was still in its infancy at the time of Cervantes.</p>
<p>Quixote made up a fantasy world in which he was a knight. Cervantes&#39; fictional historians made up stories about Quixote. And Cervantes himself? The great creator who cannot separate himself from his creation.</p>

<p>“When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“There were no embraces, because where there is great love there is often little display of it.”</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-brothers-karamazov"/>
        <updated>2021-12-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dmitri Karamazov often invokes the name of Claude Bernard as an insult for those he deems too rationalistic or materialistic. Interestingly, Bernard was acquainted with Emile Zola; many consider this duo to be the pioneers of the Naturalist movement of literature.</p>
<p>In many ways, <em>TBK</em> is a Naturalist novel. Dostoevsky proceeds in an extremely logical way, introducing the test subjects (the brothers and the father), the rich cultural backdrop that Russia provides, and the stimuli. A key piece of this is Ratikin, a somewhat unusual character. He plays a minor role, which he is remarkably bitter about (almost breaking the fourth wall) but nevertheless synthesises a remarkably lucid “hypothesis” regarding the futures of the brothers (and father) Karamazov. Dostoevsky artfully switches between the role of “creator” of the narrative, and Naturalist “discoverer” – at times it feels like he, along with the reader, is trying to piece together the facts.</p>
<p>But classifying <em>TBK</em> as purely a Naturalist novel, and thereby saying that one of its main intentions is to see how characters react under abnormal circumstances, would be an injustice. It is not just the reactions of the characters that are being examined, but their whole internal dialogues and flittering interactions of their different character traits, and more specifically how they rationalise the situation to fit with their worldview.</p>
<p>Some themes/motifs that came across from <em>TBK</em> :</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The search for truth. Superficially regarding the trial, but more specifically regarding how each of the characters is looking for the true motivation to live.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The idea of confession before the general public as being the ultimate catharsis.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Inheritance, not just financially, but also in the sense that all (four?) of the brothers contain the seed of a Karamazov.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Book V: Pro and Contra</em> really stood out – Ivan’s speeches are works of art in themselves. <em>Chapter 4: Rebellion</em> is thoughtful (if horrific), and has certainly left its mark on literature – Ursula Le Guin’s <em>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</em> draws heavily from it. <em>The Grand Inquisitor</em> is a must-read for Christians and Atheists alike – it is an analysis and cross-examination of the Temptation of Christ, and is pure art. The highlights of <em>TBK</em> for me are probably <em>Book V</em>, Zosima’s homilies, and Ivan’s meeting with the Devil.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that <em>TBK</em> is so highly respected by many world leaders. This would probably be my favourite book if I understood it better. Well worth the ~800 pages, and criminally due a re-read.</p>

<h3>Misc notes</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Written from a nonstandard point of view, as if Dostoevsky himself is trying to piece together the facts (though obviously he has access to a lot more information).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">It&#39;s almost like a theatre piece: he sets up the stage by introducing the characters and a situation. Can&#39;t help but be reminded of Zola&#39;s &#39;natural experiments&#39;.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Such fantastic digressions, which allow Dostoevsky to speak through his characters (e.g when Ivan was giving his views on the church and state).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Rakitin is a bit of an unusual character. He plays a minor role, which he is remarkably bitter about (fourth wall eh?) but nevertheless synthesises a remarkably lucid prophesy regarding the futures of the brothers (and father) Karamazov. However this is a bit contradictory with his seemingly optimistic views on mankind (at least in relation to those of Ivan): “Mankind will find strength in itself to live for virtue, even without believing in the immortality of the soul”. Whether this statement proves true remains to be seen – will any of the brothers live in virtue after conceding the nonexistence of the soul? (I’m looking at you Alexei).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">A motif seems to be the brothers’ ‘inheritance’, but money isn’t all that they have received from their father – they give in to the inner Karamazov.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Interesting how Ivan uses his of mathematics to justify that he has no right to pretend to understand God.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Book V: Pro and Contra is amazing. Ivan’s speeches are works of art.<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">I adore Ivan’s use of the term ‘Euclidean mind’ in the end of Chapter 3</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Chapter 4: Rebellion. Ivan&#39;s conclusions about torturing children are quite horrific. ‘The Ones who Walk Away from Omelas’ borrows its central idea from one of Ivan’s points.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Chapter 5: The Grand Inquisitor. A must read for Christians. An analysis and cross-examination of the temptation of christ, which is the work of genius.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The elder Zosima has some thoughts that are remarkably reminiscent of Ivan&#39;s, especially regarding the torture of children. Strange how two individuals with such different paradigms can come to same conclusions. Contributes to the theme of &#39;interpretation of facts&#39;?</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Truly terrifying when Ivan&#39;s cynical exterior breaks and reveals his inner torments. Noteworthy how the devil seems not at all different to Ivan.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">A recurring idea is that of an individual coming clean before and thence being judged by their peers:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Lise wants everyone to know her evil thoughts</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The young Zosima convinces that dude to throw everything away and confess to his murders</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Ivan wants to let his reputation burn for no obvious gain at the trial,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The judge seems to shadow Dostoevsky: &quot;an educated and humane man with a practical knowledge of his task. [...]. He was concerned with the phenomenon, its classification, seeing it as a product of our social principles, as characteristic of the Russian element&quot;. Also another reminder of Naturalism.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">But this is so much more than naturalism, it&#39;s not testing how the characters react but how their characteristics, their internal dialogues, their psyche.</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With an antifragile hammer, everything looks like a fragile nail]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Antifragile</em> is NNT’s self-proclaimed magnum opus, tying ideas from <a href="/?books=the-black-swan" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Black Swan</a> and <em>Fooled by Randomness</em> into a unified framework. Accordingly, it has everything we’ve come to expect from NNT: a near-delusional sense of self-importance, frequent bitterness (admittedly, oftentimes humorous), some neat ideas, and a rampant overreaching of these ideas.</p>
<p>My belief is that there are important ideas and there are unimportant ideas, but there are no ideas so important that they explain everything. The world is far too complex for that. Yet when you have an antifragile hammer, everything in the world becomes a nail.</p>
<p>The book is about convexity and optionality. The core idea is that any time you have an asymmetric payoff, you <em>want</em> volatility – you benefit from disorder (and time) and are thus “antifragile”. This is an important idea: limited downside with uncapped upside is something we should seek both in investment and life – too many people focus on short term results without considering the entire distribution of outcomes that they are exposed to as a result of their decisions. But it’s also important to remember that options have a finite value – something which NNT seems to selectively ignore.</p>
<p>A significant chunk of the book involves Taleb abstracting his ideas of antifragility to the realm of medicine – given his lack of credentials in this area, I’m not sure this is warranted. He is staunchly against what he calls the “interventionist” philosophy of medicine and essentially abides by Nietzche: “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger”. The advice seems occasionally sensible (avoid unnatural medication that promises small benefits in exchange for unknown/unknowable consequences, e.g thalidomide), but at other times he seems purposely belligerent, bordering on ignorant (e.g don’t use ice packs for swelling because there’s no evidence it works).</p>
<p>His discussion of “interventionism” extends beyond medicine to technology and society. The main premise is that natural things are good because they have survived the test of time (which is the ultimate destroyer of fragility). Frustratingly, Taleb concedes that some technology has been beneficial (and strongly praises Silicon Valley), but spends little time demarcating what makes some non-natural things good and others bad.</p>
<p>Another weird Talebism: NNT believes in exclusively(?) reading old books. His justification is the Lindy effect – the idea that the life expectancy of something is proportional to its age (if they are still relevant after so many years, they must be worth reading). My own thinking has slowly converged on this, e.g focussing on “evergreen” podcast content rather than current affairs podcasts, but I reject the extreme to which Taleb takes it. He suggests, for instance, that we should learn calculus by reading <em>Principia Mathematica</em> . A counterpoint: modern perspectives on old concepts are valuable because modern authors have the advantage of seeing how the concept is truly contextualised – in a way, this is as antifragile as the bottom-up villages in Switzerland that Taleb praises.</p>
<p>The main reason to read <em>Antifragile</em> is that (for better or worse) lots of pseudo-intellectuals have read it – it’s the kind of thing that could come up at a dinner party. But the concepts are semi-original at best, and while the writing style is occasionally entertaining, Taleb&#39;s pugnacity severely detracts from the book.</p>

<p>Corporate Finance: In short, corporate finance seems to be based on point projections, not distributional projections; thus if one perturbates cash flow projections, say, in the Gordon valuation model, replacing the fixed—and known—growth (and other parameters) by continuously varying jumps (particularly under fat-tailed distributions), companies deemed “expensive,” or those with high growth, but low earnings, could markedly increase in expected value, something the market prices heuristically but without explicit reason.

<p>for a deviation that is called “three sigma,” events that should take place no more than one in 740 observations, the probability rises by 60% if one moves the standard deviation up by 5%, and drops by 40% if we move the standard deviation down by 5%. So if your error is on average a tiny 5%, the underestimation from a naive model is about 20%. Great asymmetry, but nothing yet. It gets worse as one looks for more deviations, the “six sigma” ones (alas, chronically frequent in economics): a rise of five times more. The rarer the event (i.e., the higher the “sigma”), the worse the effect from small uncertainty about what to put in the equation. With events such as ten sigma, the difference is more than a billion times. (loc 7938)</p>

<p>Even taking a Gaussian with σ the standard deviation having a proportional error a(1); a(1) has an error rate a(2), etc. Now it depends on the higher order error rate a(n) related to a(n−1); if these are in constant proportion, then we converge to a very thick-tailed distribution. If proportional errors decline, we still have fat tails. In all cases mere error is not a good thing for small probability. (loc 7964)</p>

<p>academics (particularly in social science) seem to distrust each other; they live in petty obsessions, envy, and icy-cold hatreds, with small snubs developing into grudges, fossilized over time in the loneliness of the transaction with a computer screen and the immutability of their environment. Not to mention a level of envy I have almost never seen in business.… My experience is that money and transactions purify relations; ideas and abstract matters like “recognition” and “credit” warp them, creating an atmosphere of perpetual rivalry.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Girls Like Us</em> is a horrific look into America’s domestic sex industry. The glamorised media portrayal of escorts and call-girls obscures the reality: widespread and commercialised sexual exploitation of minors.</p>
<p>The tragedy is that in spite of such obvious suffering, legislators (who are predominantly old white men) and the media have little sympathy for the victims of exploitation: they stigmatise victims, implying that these 14-year-olds have voluntarily entered the sex industry for money, while simultaneously insisting that anyone below the age of 16 can’t give legal consent.</p>
<p><em>Girls Like Us</em> is an important read, and together with <a href="/?books=the-new-jim-crow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The New Jim Crow</a> should make us realise how much distance we have to cover before we can consider ourselves a civilised society.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am a flashing neon sign for danger, for abuse, for a tragic ending. A perfect conflation of risk factors, a statistic waiting to happen.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It reminds me of a macabre version of the Choose Your Own Adventure books: A few options along the way will ultimately lead to one of not many outcomes. If you chose running away from your mom, skip to page 6, where you’ll meet a pimp at the subway.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>These victims, many of whom are adults, have made choices. But their choices must be seen in context. Most of them have little to no other legitimate options.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There are a million rationalizations that men employ to deny the exploitation that they’re a part of.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>there is a demonstrated link between the availability of the adult sex industry and the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The absurdity of having an explicit sexual conversation with a girl who is being abused by adult men every day, then arresting her and expecting her to talk to or “snitch” on the man she loves to the same male officers who had treated her both as a sexual object and as a criminal, was startling.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Girls relapse because the pain is no longer tangible. Human beings have a remarkable ability to forget pain. We all remember feeling sad, or hurt, or in physical pain, but we don’t feel it anymore; it’s a cerebral memory, not a physical one. This great defense mechanism probably accounts for the survival of the human race. It’s what enables a woman to go through the pain of childbirth again. It’s what enables us to date again after a soul-crushing divorce, to trust people after horrific betrayals.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trippy, fast-paced, genre-defining cyberpunk with a prescient vision of AI]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I first attempted to read <em>Neuromancer</em> early on in my &quot;reading career&quot; – around 2015. It was incomprehensible, made me feel stupid, and I hated it. I am <em>so</em> glad I gave it another chance. <em>Neuromancer</em> is a trippy, fast-paced, genre-defining cyberpunk novel.</p>
<p>Written in 1984, <em>Neuromancer</em> is a fascinating vision of what cybersecurity and AI would look like in the future. Gibson’s take is remarkably prescient – though it’s interesting to see that he underestimated some aspects of general computing power (e.g. referring to megabytes as a lot), while overestimating the capabilities of AI. The novel gives me strong PKD vibes: the setting is similar to Bladerunner (gritty, Tokyo-inspired nights) and the plot reminds me of <a href="/?books=ubik" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Ubik</a><em>.</em> The novel’s antihero, Case, is far more interesting than the average PKD protagonist, though as is typical for scifi, some character development is sacrificed for the sake of interesting concepts.</p>
<p>The amusing thing is that in some ways, <em>Neuromancer</em> ’s dystopia is more enlightened than the world we live in. All AIs have to be registered on the Turing registry and law enforcement aggressively tries to prevent modifications that would allow an AI to reach the singularity. Despite the pleas of AI safety researchers, our world has no such protocol. For-profit companies and military agencies deploy AI with minimal safeguards, knowing frighteningly little about the long term consequences (discussed in <a href="/?books=the-precipice" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Precipice</a>).</p>
<p><em>Neuromancer</em> remains a relatively difficult read. The writing is snappy to the point of being hard to follow, with short, disjointed sentences and broken dialogue. It’s sometimes difficult to know what’s going on (similar to <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> ). But if you’re willing to yield control and just go with the flow, you’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>The Japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than the Chinese had ever known. The black clinics of Chiba were the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly, and still they couldn’t repair the damage he’d suffered in that Memphis hotel. (loc 97)</p>

<p>Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button. Stop hustling and you sank without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you’d break the fragile surface tension of the black market; either way, you were gone, with nothing left of you but some vague memory in the mind of a fixture like Ratz, though heart or lungs or kidneys might survive in the service of some stranger with New Yen for the clinic tanks.

<p>Biz here was a constant subliminal hum, and death the accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of grace, the failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol. (loc 148)</p>

<p>There were countless theories explaining why Chiba City tolerated the Ninsei enclave, but Case tended toward the idea that the Yakuza might be preserving the place as a kind of historical park, a reminder of humble origins. But he also saw a certain sense in the notion that burgeoning technologies require outlaw zones, that Night City wasn’t there for its inhabitants, but as a deliberately unsupervised playground for technology itself. (loc 211)</p>

<p>“No. I saw her death coming. In the patterns you sometimes imagined you could detect in the dance of the street. Those patterns are real. I am complex enough, in my narrow ways, to read those dances. Far better than Wintermute can. I saw her death in her need for you, in the magnetic code of the lock on the door of your coffin in Cheap Hotel, in Julie Deane’s account with a Hongkong shirtmaker. As clear to me as the shadow of a tumor to a surgeon studying a patient’s scan. (loc 3949)</p>

<p>It took three more jumps up the ladder before he reached Tessier-Ashpool. “Dixie,” he said, jacking in, “what do you know about Chinese virus programs?” “Not a whole hell of a lot.” “Ever hear of a grading system like Kuang, Mark Eleven?” “No.” Case sighed. “Well, I got a user-friendly Chinese icebreaker here, a one shot cassette. Some people in Frankfurt say it’ll cut an Al.” “Possible. Sure. If it’s military.” (loc 2028)</p>

<p>In the bars he’d frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh. (loc 123)</p>

<p>Armitage seems to be setting up a run on an Al that belongs to Tessier-Ashpool. The mainframe’s in Berne, but it’s linked with another one in Rio. The one in Rio is the one that flatlined you, that first time. So it looks like they link via Straylight, the T-A home base, down the end of the spindle, and we’re supposed to cut our way in with the Chinese icebreaker. So if Wintermute’s backing the whole show it’s paying us to burn it. (loc 2035)</p>

<p>what you think of as Wintermute is only a part of another, a, shall we say, potential entity. I, let us say, am merely one aspect of that entity’s brain.

<p>Why he has to come on like the Finn or somebody, he told me that. It’s not just a mask, it’s like he uses real profiles as valves, gears himself down to communicate with us. Called it a template. Model of personality.” (loc 3188)</p>

Marie-France, my lady, she prepared this road but her lord choked her off before I could read the book of he; days. Neuro from the nerves, the silver paths. Romancer. Necromancer. I call up the dead. But no, my friend,” and the boy did a little dance, brown feet printing the sand, “I am the dead, and their land.” He laughed. A gull cried. “Stay. If your woman is a ghost, she doesn’t know it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The precursors to Lovecraft’s cosmic horror]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Gothic Tales</em> is a well-curated mix of stories, emphasising Lovecraft&#39;s original gothic writing rather than the cosmic horror for which he later became famous.</p>
<p>The language is beautiful, though after a while you realise that Lovecraft uses the same few words and motifs everywhere (e.g &quot;eldritch gnarled roots&quot;). Not only that, Lovecraft actually repeats settings quite often (”Lovecraft Country”). This really isn&#39;t a bad thing – he&#39;s has created a handful of perfectly creepy environments so I think he has every right to explore them via multiple plots.</p>
<p>Some of the purely gothic stories are rather predictable (in fairness, this may not have been the case in the early 20th century when they were first published), though again, they’re worth reading for the rich and grotesque imagery. However, some of the other stories are truly riveting and disturbing, for example, <em>The Lurking Fear, The Hound</em> (which included Lovecraft&#39;s first reference to the Necronomicon), <em>The Strange High House in the Mist</em> , and <em>The Haunter in the Dark</em> . My favourite piece in the anthology (by far) was <em>The Music of Erich Zann</em> , perfectly melding a gothic style with subtle hints towards cosmic horror.</p>

        <updated>2021-12-25T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At times, <em>The Hard Thing</em> reads a bit like Ben Horowitz congratulating himself for decisions he made as CEO as Opsware. But I think this is more a characteristic of the writing – in truth, Horowitz is reflective and extracts several valuable lessons from his experiences.</p>
<p>Unlike many other startup books, this one focuses a lot on the CEO – the person who makes everything happen. Instead of presenting management strategy at a high level, Horowitz goes into great detail about the psyche of a CEO, recounting the qualitative aspects of executing a corporate plan and the tough job of getting buy-in from employees, executives and investors. As such, it&#39;s a really interesting counterbalance to the clinical &quot;Harvard Business School Case Study&quot; culture that increasingly pervades business literature.</p>
<p>To summarise the message of this book, startup life is HARD. If you are going into a startup (particularly as a founder), you should expect hard things. You need to love this and thrive under the existential pressure. Otherwise, it’ll eat you up.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (Dec 2021)</strong>: the peacetime vs wartime analogy is useful in trading. It’s good to have strategies that can make money in calm waters, but you need to be paranoid about the blowups. That is when careers are made or broken.</p>

<p>There may be nothing scarier in business than facing an existential threat. So scary that many in the organization will do anything to avoid facing it. They will look for any alternative, any way out, any excuse not to live or die in a single battle.</p>
<p><em>Sometimes it’s better to face the market head on.</em></p>

<p>Entrepreneur: “We have the best product in the market by far. All the customers love it and prefer it to competitor X.” Me: “Why does competitor X have five times your revenue?” Entrepreneur: “We are using partners and OEMs, because we can’t build a direct channel like competitor X.” Me: “Why not? If you have the better product, why not knuckle up and go to war?” Entrepreneur: “Ummm.” Me: “Stop looking for the silver bullet.” There comes a time in every company’s life where it must fight for its life. If you find yourself running when you should be fighting, you need to ask yourself, “If our company isn’t good enough to win, then do we need to exist at all?”</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not sure about the coherence of Manson’s philosophy – if you could call it that. But criticisms of <em>The Subtle Art</em> on these grounds miss the point. I don’t think it’s a book that should be read too critically: the message comes through quite clearly, even if the evidence is mostly anecdotal and the tone obnoxious.</p>
<p>Manson’s core message is not that you shouldn’t care about anything – rather, that you should seriously consider what is worth caring about. Take the chapter on self-awareness. Essentially, when something upsets you, you need to adopt the Socratic method, asking yourself “why” several times. This will lead to a differentiation between your values (e.g I want to be successful) and your metrics (e.g I measure success by salary) – then you can further question whether your values and metrics are sensible. It’s both logical and actionable.</p>
<p><em>The Subtle Art</em> contains many generic self-help concepts that we all “know about” – it’s ok to be adequate, it’s ok not to fit in etc. But nevertheless, it’s important to have a constant reminder and the colourful language does help. I’m a fan of the book, but I can see that some might not be. And I don’t give a f*ck about that.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (Dec 2021):</strong> those of you who have met me may (or may not) be surprised to know that I used to be very anxious in social situations. <em>The Subtle Art</em> was one of several books that helped me break through a downward spiral of making mistakes at social occasions then subsequently allowing my worry to make it worse.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Suffering</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell; you say to yourself, “I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?” And then, as if sprinkled by magic fuck-giving fairy dust, you stop hating yourself for feeling so bad.</p>
<p><em>This is the important part – breaking out of the loop of being annoyed at oneself for feeling bad.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—our own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature.</p>
<p><em>Use dissatisfaction as a motivator.</em></p>

<p>Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way.</p>

<p>The problem with the self-esteem movement is that it measured self-esteem by how positively people felt about themselves. But a true and accurate measurement of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>there are also problems that we aren’t at fault for, yet we are still responsible for them.</p>
<p><em>Responsibility ≠ blame. Good decisions can have bad outcomes.</em></p>

<p>It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure.</p>

<p>You can become your own source of inspiration. You can become your own source of motivation. Action is always within reach. And with simply doing something as your only metric for success—well, then even failure pushes you forward.</p>
<p><em>Fiddle with your values and metrics to find the most “productive” combinations.</em></p>

<p>The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement.</p>
<p><em>Stop moping, get out and fix yourself!</em></p>

<p>there’s another, even deeper level of the self-awareness onion. And that one is full of fucking tears. The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Two things are operating here: a value that I hold dear, and a metric that I use to assess progress toward that value. My value: brothers are supposed to have a good relationship with one another. My metric: being in contact by phone or email—this is how I measure my success as a brother. By holding on to this metric, I make myself feel like a failure,</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable. Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What are we choosing to give a fuck about? What values are we choosing to base our actions on? What metrics are we choosing to use to measure our life? And are those good choices—good values and good metrics?</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scifi that requires a PhD in physics]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A common joke (in sci-fi circles) is that appreciating Egan’s fiction requires a PhD in physics. This possibly applies to a couple of the stories in this collection and is almost definitely true for his novel <a href="/?books=diaspora" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Diaspora</a>, but most of the stories are accessible and simply excellent sci-fi.</p>
<p><em>The Hundred-Light-Year-Diary</em> is a good example of this: it is set in a near-future society where everyone is able to send short messages back in time, creating a ‘lifetime diary’ which they can read in advance of the events. But Egan doesn’t just use this as a premise, he <em>derives</em> it from fully believable physics. The physics notwithstanding, the implications are extremely interesting – how does romance change? Is the future avoidable? It’s a great take on time loops: you can’t avoid the future any more than you can avoid the past. <em>Into Darkness</em> is one of the stories which I think I would have been able to appreciate much more with a degree in physics... wormhole dynamics are quite complex.</p>
<p>Egan frequently explores mind-body dualism: a recurring idea is the ‘Ndoli Device’, a small jewel implanted in people’s brains that exactly mimics the actions of the brain. When people get to a certain age, most of them undergo a common surgical procedure to destroy their biological brain (which will only degrade over time) and replace it with the immortal jewel. What’s the difference between this jewel and you? <em>Learning to be Me</em> is a fascinating exploration of the self.</p>
<p>There are also a couple of biology-based stories: <em>The Moral Virologist</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Caress</em>, the former of which is a darkly amusing and blithely scathing take on religious fundamentalism.</p>
<p><em>Axiomatic</em> is not perfect, there are several cases where the characters seem to suddenly realise the predicament they are in (often stretching narrative convenience). But this doesn’t really matter to me. Egan is the closest I have found to Vonnegut’s fictional author Kilgore Trout.</p>
<p>The best stories :</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>The Hundred-Light-Year Diary</em> [see above]</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>The Caress</em> - a bit grotesque, biology-based. What are the limits of art?</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Safe-Deposit Box</em> - in a constant state of change, what is the meaning of the self?</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Learning to be Me</em> [see above]</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Into Darkness</em> - wormholes spawn randomly across the Earth’s surface and destroy everything inside them once they collapse</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">T<em>he Moral Virologist</em> [see above]</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Closer</em> - what does it mean to be intimately close to someone? What is gained and lost by fully understanding your partner?</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Unstable Orbits in the Space of Lies</em> - a global ‘meltdown’ causes everyone to share the same beliefs as people in their proximity. There is world peace because as soon as you cross a boundary, you’re instantly converted to a different religion.</li>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<p><strong>The Hundred-Light-Year-Diary</strong></p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p><em>The Hundred-Light-Year-Diary</em> describes a society in the near future that is able to send back short messages in time.</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>But it doesn’t just use that as a premise, it actually <em>derives</em> it from fully believable circumstances (with a powerful enough telescope, you may be able to look somewhere into the universe where the arrow of time runs the opposite way). The telescope has to emit a photon when it looks at this galaxy: if the galaxy is obstructed, the telescope must stop emitting <em>before</em> the obstruction happened. Genius.</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Very very interesting perspective of time loops: treat messages from the future just like messages from the past. You can’t really avoid the future, any more than you can avoid the past.</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Messages from the future also have the same ‘historicity” problems as messages from the past.<br><strong>The Caress</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Quite an unsettling story that leaves you wanting to know more about the future.</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>I think it’s just right how obvious he makes the stuff (for example how emotionless the detective is on discovering the Chimera).<br><strong>The Safe-Deposit Box</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Good scifi honestly</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>I guess it does exemplify one of the minor annoyances in Egan’s stories: for plot purposes, the protagonists are often able to make ‘genius’ ansatzes that just so happen to be true. In this story, the protagonist hypothesises that he is the experimented child; in the Caress the detective figures out that it’s Lindhquist.<br><strong>Learning to be me</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>I guess the ‘twist’ (that the main character is the jewel) isn’t too hard to see, but it is a rich philosophical story about cartesian dualism<br><strong>Into Darkness</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Reading this makes me wish I had a physics degree (I’ll get there one day).</p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>The completely natural descriptions of the characteristics of the wormhole are terrifying yet austerely ‘realistic’.<br><strong>The Moral Virologist</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>Scathing satire of religious conservatism; a brilliant example of hard sci-fi.<br><strong>Closer</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><p>What does it mean to be intimately close to someone? What is gained and lost by fully understanding your partner?</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=factfulness"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world is bad, and getting better.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although I liked this book, it is one of those books for which personal opinions are mostly irrelevant. It matters not whether the book is good or bad because it is <em>necessary</em> . Bill Gates has given this book the ultimate blessing by buying the book for all college graduates. If this is not a sufficient vote of confidence, I wouldn&#39;t know what is.</p>
<p>The essential thesis of <em>Factfulness</em> is that most of the world does not know what the world is really like. Regardless of education levels, people are consistently worse than random at answering simple questions about the state of the world. What percentage of the world has access to electricity? Or what portion of children have been vaccinated? The answers are pleasantly surprising – we often think the world is far worse than it truly is!</p>
<p>It is an uncomfortable read because Rosling is essentially saying that you are wrong about the world. Not just in what you say, but in how you think about it. The old classifications of &quot;More developed country (MDC)&quot; and &quot;Less developed country (LDC)&quot; simply do not apply.</p>
<p>We (in the West) tend to have post-colonial mindsets, ignoring the encouraging progress of the world as a whole. Rosling does a great job of telling you that you are wrong without blaming you for it. The key takeaway is the somewhat oxymoronic phrase: the world is bad, and getting better. Let us not forget the second half of the phrase!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>The gap instinct makes us imagine division where there is just a smooth range, difference where there is a convergence, and conflict where there is agreement.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain’t what they used to be. […] Most things used to be worse, not better. But it is extremely easy for humans to forget how things really did “used to be”.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I am a possibilist. [Change] won’t happen by itself, and if we lose all hope because of stupid misconceptions, it may not happen at all.</p>
<p><em>Progress is a good motivator for future progress</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There was a balance. It wasn’t because humans lived in balance with nature. Humans died in balance with nature. […] For the first time in human history, we live in a balance.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Our press may be free, and professional, and truth-seeking, but independent is not the same as representative.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consciousness, computation, being.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am at a loss for words in describing <em>Permutation City.</em> Of all the fiction books I have read (maybe even including non-fiction), this is the one that has made me think the most. It’s a masterpiece of philosophical scifi, with an extremely intricate and thoughtful discussion of what it means to be conscious, and a delightful exploration of what reality means.</p>
<p><em>Permutation City</em> considers a world where people can scan and upload their consciousness to make Copies, which are run on remote servers. In classic Egan fashion, he gives a practical and ‘realistic’ description of server loads/quotas almost perfectly parallels the real situation with Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. Cloned consciousness is a theme that Egan explores frequently in his short stories (see <a href="/?books=axiomatic" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Axiomatic</a>), but <em>Permutation City</em> focuses more on the interactions between clones and “originals”.</p>
<p>The climax of the book is <em>spectacular.</em> I sat still for half an hour trying to process what happened – even though I probably don’t understand it well enough to explain it to someone else, just understanding the edges of the idea left me dazzled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as with all of Egan’s works, it’s difficult for me to recommend <em>Permutation City</em> to a general audience, as one of the central plot points regards automata theory, a topic from theoretical computer science. There may also be some red-herring story arcs, but I don’t feel that these detract at all from the intellectual grandeur of the novel. If you are willing to make the effort to understand cellular automata (Conway’s Game of Life is the classic example), and to keep a wide-open mind about the nature of consciousness, <em>Permutation City</em> is incredibly rewarding and among the best science fiction I’ve had the privilege of reading.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (Dec 2021):</strong> it has been several years since I read Permutation City, but I still think about this book frequently. Definitely due for a re-read.</p>

<p>none of the other Copies had reported anything similar … but then, none of them had volunteered much useful data at all. They’d just ranted abuse, whined about their plight, and then terminated themselves – all within fifteen (subjective) minutes of gaining consciousness.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For any human, absolute proof of a Copy’s sentience was impossible. For any Copy, the truth was self-evident: cogito ergo sum. End of discussion.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But … when, exactly, did these snapshots give rise to conscious thought? While they were being computed? Or in the brief interludes when they sat in the computer’s memory, unchanging, doing nothing but representing one static instant of the Copy’s life?</p>
<p><em>Just wow.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What am I? The data? The process that generates it? The relationships between the numbers?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Durham said, “Almost six years ago – loosely speaking – a man I know made a Copy of himself. When the Copy woke up, it panicked, and tried to bale out. But the original had sabotaged the software; baling out was impossible.” “That’s illegal.” “I know.” “So who was this man?” “His name was Paul Durham.” “You? You were the original?” “Oh, no. I was the Copy.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A normal human death was one thing – woven into a much vaster tapestry, it was a process which made perfect sense. From the internal point of view of a Copy whose model was simply halted, though, there was no explanation whatsoever for its demise – just an edge where the pattern abruptly came to an end.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>So the two subjective histories remained as one. Paul had been a visitor believing he was a Copy. And he’d also been the Copy itself. The patterns had merged seamlessly; there could be no way of saying that one history was true and the other false. Both explanations were equally valid.</p>
<p><em>This links to the climax of the plot! There is no meaningful way in which one pattern’s explanation has primacy over the other. Just as the Autoverse’s inhabitants’ theory for reality is no more primal than the Elysian explanation (that the Autoverse is a simulation).</em></p>

<p>Lambert and his followers had staked out the middle ground. They’d invented a new physics, simple enough to allow several thousand bacteria to fit into a modest computer simulation, with a consistent, unbroken hierarchy of details existing right down to the subatomic scale. Everything was driven from the bottom up, by the lowest level of physical laws, just as it was in the real world.</p>
<p><em>Scarily, this is basically no longer science fiction. In the OpenWorm project, a nematode worm was simulated down to the cellular level.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“The Church of the God Who Makes No Difference has no position on Copies, one way or the other.” “It has no position on anything.” “That’s right. So it can hardly be their fault that I don’t want to be scanned, can it?”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“So if I set up a cellular automaton in a Garden-of-Eden configuration, run it through a few trillion clock ticks, then shut it down … the pattern will continue to find itself in the dust – separate from this version of me, separate from this world – but still flowing unambiguously from that initial state. A state which can’t be explained by the rules of the automaton. A state which must have been constructed in another world – exactly as I remember it.</p>
<p><em>In some sense, once you have written the rules of an automaton and provided an initial configuration, that entire set of patterns exists. So if you code a simulation of reality into it, that</em> **<em>creates</em> **<em>a reality. This is what he means by “finding itself in the dust”.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Durham’s logic was impeccable; an endlessly-expanding TVC universe, with new computing power being manufactured out of nothing in all directions, “would” eventually be big enough to run an Autoverse planet – or even a whole planetary system.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Immortality would have been meaningless, trapped in a “machine” with a finite number of possible states; in a finite time he would have exhausted the list of every possible thing he could be. Only the promise of eternal growth made sense of eternal life.</p>
<p><em>True digital immortality requires infinite space, else you will run out of things to do!</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“What are you suggesting? That Elysium is now a computer program being run somewhere in the Autoverse?” “No. But there’s a symmetry to it. A principle of relativity. Elysium was envisioned as a fixed frame of reference, a touchstone of reality – against which the Autoverse could be declared a mere simulation. The truth has turned out to be more subtle: there are no fixed points, no immovable objects, no absolute laws.”</p>
<p><em>Wow Wow Wow. If Elysium simulates Autoverse, but Autoverse finds self-consistent field laws for the simulation and in a sense “proves” that Elysium is the simulation... then who is the simulator?</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“It’s not just a matter of the Lambertians out-explaining us. The whole idea of a creator tears itself apart. A universe with conscious beings either finds itself in the dust … or it doesn’t. It either makes sense of itself on its own terms, as a self-contained whole … or not at all. There never can, and never will be, Gods.”</div></details></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mediocre telling of the Theranos debacle]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Bad Blood</em> is a fascinating story – I had come across bits and pieces of it before, for example, a youtube video of Elizabeth Holmes suddenly switching from her real voice to her fake-deep voice, but it was quite different to read the full account. One thing that becomes apparent is that Holmes seems to have a mind-control field – how else could she have convinced ex-Secretaries of State/Defence, Four-star generals, top-flight lawyers to join her board and become her personal attack squadron?</p>
<p>Holmes had a combination of charisma, intelligence, and drive – all the makings of a successful entrepreneur. I think the problem was that she got caught up in her own legend; she wanted so much to be like Steve Jobs that she was willing to cut corners and defraud patients/investors to preserve her image.</p>
<p>The first half of <em>Bad Blood</em> is not amazingly well written. There are too many interjections and the stories overlap. I groaned when John Carreyou started talking in the first person about how he got in touch with ex-Theranos employees, but actually, this portion of the book is quite engaging. I&#39;ve read a couple of WSJ investigations-turned-books, but <em>Bad Blood</em> has been the only one to shed light on the process of investigative journalism. It also serves to highlight another unpleasant aspect of Holmes – her willingness to pay top dollar to big-shot lawyers to bully the little guy into silence. Overall an interesting story, but a mediocre book.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>After some discussion, the four men reached a consensus: they would remove Elizabeth as CEO. She had proven herself too young and inexperienced for the job. Tom Brodeen would step in to lead the company for a temporary period until a more permanent replacement could be found. They called in Elizabeth to confront her with what they had learned and inform her of their decision. But then something extraordinary happened. Over the course of the next two hours, Elizabeth convinced them to change their minds.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>some of Greg’s colleagues in the engineering department began to notice that Elizabeth was borrowing behaviors and management techniques described in Walter Isaacson’s biography of the late Apple founder. They were all reading the book too and could pinpoint which chapter she was on based on which period of Jobs’s career she was impersonating.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mattis went out of his way to praise her integrity. “She has probably one of the most mature and well-honed sense of ethics—personal ethics, managerial ethics, business ethics, medical ethics that I’ve ever heard articulated,” the retired general gushed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>THE TERM “VAPORWARE” was coined in the early 1980s to describe new computer software or hardware that was announced with great fanfare only to take years to materialize, if it did at all. It was a reflection of the computer industry’s tendency to play it fast and loose when it came to marketing. Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle were all accused of engaging in the practice at one point or another. Such overpromising became a defining feature of Silicon Valley. The harm done to consumers was minor, measured in frustration and deflated expectations. By positioning Theranos as a tech company in the heart of the Valley, Holmes channeled this fake-it-until-you-make-it culture, and she went to extreme lengths to hide the fakery.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>By all accounts, she had a vision that she genuinely believed in and threw herself into realizing. But in her all-consuming quest to be the second coming of Steve Jobs amid the gold rush of the “unicorn” boom, there came a point when she stopped listening to sound advice and began to cut corners. Her ambition was voracious and it brooked no interference. If there was collateral damage on her way to riches and fame, so be it.</p>
<p>...</p>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed]]></title>
        <id>https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=black-box-thinking</id>
        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=black-box-thinking"/>
        <updated>2021-12-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Black Box Thinking</em> is based on the simple premise that some people (and some industries) learn from their mistakes, while others don&#39;t. Flying is widely considered the safest form of travel – but this is only because the industry obsessively seeks to improve its processes (by analysing black boxes after incidents) and promptly rolls out any necessary changes.</p>
<p>The main contrasting example is medicine – Syed details how well-meaning (and highly competent) medical professionals inhibit their improvement loop while suggesting structural changes to improve this.</p>
<p>This book was recommended to me by a senior investment professional, and I can see why. Even the best stock pickers in the world have a hit rate of only ~60%, so it’s incredibly important to have the right attitude to failure.</p>
<p><em>Black Box Thinking</em> is written very well and reads easily – I got a lot of value from the book and would wholeheartedly recommend it. My key takeaway: learning to make mistakes is a big part of learning to learn.</p>
<hr>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Learning from mistakes</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Self-justification, allied to a wider cultural allergy to failure, morphs into an almost insurmountable barrier to progress.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This, then, is what we might call “black box thinking.”* For organizations beyond aviation, it is not about creating a literal black box; rather, it is about the willingness and tenacity to investigate the lessons that often exist when we fail, but which we rarely exploit. It is about creating systems and cultures that enable organizations to learn from errors, rather than being threatened by them.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more likely to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs. We simply invent new reasons, new justifications, new explanations. Sometimes we ignore the evidence altogether.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the most effective cover-ups are perpetrated not by those who are covering their backs, but by those who don’t even realize that they have anything to hide.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It is precisely those thinkers who are most renowned, who are famous for their brilliant minds, who have the most to lose from mistakes. And that is why it is often the most influential people, those who ought to be in the best position to help the world learn from new evidence, who have the greatest incentive to reframe it.</p>
<p><em>One reason to not blindly trust experts</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Closed loops are often perpetuated by people covering up mistakes. They are also kept in place when people spin their mistakes, rather than confronting them head on. But there is a third way that closed loops are sustained over time: through skewed interpretation.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Creativity in organisations</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The groups with the dissent and criticize guidelines generated 25 percent more ideas than those who were brainstorming (or who had no instructions).</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The problem with brainstorming is not its insistence on free-wheeling or quick association. Rather, it is that when these ideas are not checked by the feedback of criticism, they have nothing to respond to. Criticism surfaces problems. It brings difficulties to light. This forces us to think afresh. When our assumptions are violated we are nudged into a new relationship with reality. Removing failure from innovation is like removing oxygen from a fire.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Winners require innovation and discipline, the imagination to see the big picture and the focus to perceive the very small. “The great task, rarely achieved, is to blend creative intensity with relentless discipline so as to amplify the creativity rather than destroy it,” Collins writes. “When you marry operating excellence with innovation, you multiply the value of your creativity.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Blame vs accountability</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Instant blame often leads to what has been called a “circular firing squad.” This is where everyone is blaming everyone else. It is familiar in business, politics and the military.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Holding people accountable and [unfairly] blaming people are two quite different things,” Sidney Dekker, one of the world’s leading thinkers on complex systems, has said. “Blaming people may in fact make them less accountable: They will tell fewer accounts, they may feel less compelled to have their voice heard, to participate in improvement efforts.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In a simple world, blame, as a management technique, made sense. When you are on a one-dimensional production line, for example, mistakes are obvious, transparent, and are often caused by a lack of focus.</p>
<p>But in a complex world this analysis flips on its head. In the worlds of business, politics, aviation, and health care, people often make mistakes for subtle, situational reasons. The problem is often not a lack of focus, it is a consequence of complexity.</p>
<p><em>Re trading, need to find a firm that is understanding of this</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This doesn’t mean that blame is never justified. If, after investigation, it turns out that a person was genuinely negligent, then punishment is not only justifiable, but imperative.</p>
<p><em>Understanding the importance of mistakes does not mean removing consequences</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“When you see an incident, your brain just seems to scream out: ‘What the hell was the pilot thinking!’ It is a knee-jerk response. It takes real discipline to probe the black box data without prejudging the issue.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>As the philosopher Karl Popper put it: “True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A growth-oriented culture is not a naïvely optimistic, wishy-washy, we-are-all-winners approach to business or life. And it is certainly not a trope of egalitarian sensibilities. Rather, it is a cutting-edge approach to organizational psychology based upon the most basic scientific principle of all: we progress fastest when we face up to failure—and learn from it.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Evidence-based reasoning</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>And yet often in the social world this presumption is flipped. Arguments are deemed more compelling when stripped of evidence. Instead, we admire conviction, which is often a synonym for gut feeling. Chris Grayling, then the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice in the UK, once said: “The last Government was obsessed with pilots [i.e., pilot schemes]. Sometimes you just have to believe in something and do it.” This contempt for evidence echoes the stance of the pre-scientific age.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Great coaches are not interested in merely creating an environment where adaptation can take place, they are focused on the “meta” question of which training system is the most effective. They don’t just want players to improve, but to do so as fast and as profoundly as possible.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Marginal gains is not about making small changes and hoping they fly. Rather, it is about breaking down a big problem into small parts in order to rigorously establish what works and what doesn’t. Ultimately the approach emerges from a basic property of empirical evidence: to find out if something is working, you must isolate its effect. Controlled experimentation is inherently “marginal” in character.</p>

<p>Harrah’s Casino Group is symbolic of the quiet revolution that has been taking place. The brand, which operates casinos and resorts across America, reportedly has three golden rules for staff: “Don’t harass women, don’t steal, and you’ve got to have a control group.”</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harrowing look at the criminal justice system in America]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alexander provides a convincing case that despite claims of progressiveness or colourblindness, America presents a social system that is disturbingly similar to the Jim Crow era, in which people of colour were “separate but equal”. Racism didn’t end with <em>Brown vs Board of Education</em> , it just morphed into something more subtle.</p>
<p>There seems to be something seriously wrong with both police enforcement and the judicial system. Police officers continue to blatantly violate constitutional rights and are even incentivised to do so because of civil forfeiture. Prosecutors can use their “discretion” to levy bogus charges on whoever they please (guess what, white people often get out unscathed). The Supreme Court, meant to be the noble protectors of the marginalised as per the fourteenth amendment, seem to care more about the status quo and the letter of the law than true justice. White presidents, in attempts to be “tough on crime” to bolster their political standings, callously waged a War on Drugs that disproportionately impacted people of colour and has resulted in shocking levels of incarceration. America is also unique in the way it treats drug felons, many of whom find after leaving prison that they don’t have a vote, are ineligible for state housing, and have immense difficulties in finding a job: the system is almost designed to send them back into prison to continue the systematic oppression of racial minorities.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on colourblindness and the classic American dream that anyone can succeed. Doing so ignores the reality that certain ostensibly colourblind policies are extremely effective in marginalising people of colour.</p>
<p>This was quite a long book. I felt that some parts were a little repetitive as Alexander got carried away in rhetoric – in many areas the facts speak damningly for themselves!</p>

<p>In the era of colorblindness, it is no longer socially permissible to use race, explicitly, as a justification for discrimination, exclusion, and social contempt. So we don’t. Rather than rely on race, we use our criminal justice system to label people of color “criminals” and then engage in all the practices we supposedly left behind.</p>

<p>Highly visible examples of black success are critical to the maintenance of a racial caste system in the era of colorblindness.</p>

<p>Most Americans probably have no idea how common it is for people to be convicted without ever having the benefit of legal representation, or how many people plead guilty to crimes they did not commit because of fear of mandatory sentences.</p>

<p>The risk that African Americans would be unfairly targeted should have been of special concern to the U.S. Supreme Court—the one branch of government charged with the responsibility of protecting “discrete and insular minorities” from the excesses of majoritarian democracy, and guaranteeing constitutional rights for groups deemed unpopular or subject to prejudice.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are well aware that the exercise of their discretion is unchecked, provided no explicitly racist remarks are made, as it is next to impossible for defendants to prove racial bias. It is difficult to imagine a system better designed to ensure that racial biases and stereotypes are given free reign—while at the same time appearing on the surface to be colorblind—than the one devised by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We, as a nation, seem comfortable with 90 percent of the people arrested and convicted of drug offenses in some states being African American, but if the figure were 100 percent, the veil of colorblindness would be lost.</p>

<p>It is far more convenient to imagine that a majority of young African American men in urban areas freely chose a life of crime than to accept the real possibility that their lives were structured in a way that virtually guaranteed their early admission into a system from which they can never escape.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-regulation is hard when incentive drives behaviour]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A wonderfully balanced exposition of the Libor scandal. Enrich manages to artfully tell the tale of Tom Hayes, neither excusing his actions nor demonising him.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Libor system was a fascinating experiment into what happens if you let financial institutions self-regulate. Banks could submit their own estimates of Libor, so it wasn&#39;t long before traders realised they could submit estimates that would skew the final number in a way that benefitted their positions. The brazenness with which the traders and brokers then manipulated the rates was a product of the silence of the Bank of England and FCA. This is not a defence of the manipulators, but another observation of the platitude &quot;incentive drives behaviour&quot;.</p>
<p>An added dimension or complexity was Hayes&#39; diagnosis of a mild form of Asperger&#39;s. According to the psychiatrists, this meant that Hayes had a tendency to see the world in black and white - so when bosses, colleagues, and basically everyone in his sphere was doing the same Libor manipulation, Hayes could not appreciate the ethical shades of grey. It is curious that the judge refused to let the jury consider this as evidence; it is another question entirely as to whether juries can adequately serve justice in complex financial cases such as this (particularly given a general mistrust of bankers).</p>
<p><em>The Spider Network</em> is incredibly well written and is one of those nonfiction finance books that is informative, gripping, and worrying in equal measure.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>“Money can’t make you happy, but it does allow you to be miserable in comfort,” he counseled his son.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>By the time Hayes appeared on his radar, Farr was a veteran. But he had never mastered the technical side of things. His boss regarded him as hardworking but “not the sharpest person in the box.” (More than a decade later, Farr would remain confused about the defining characteristics of the instruments, such as interest-rate swaps, that he was helping clients trade.)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>For every $100 that a trader generated for a broker in commissions, the broker recycled $5 or $10 of that back to the trader in the form of “entertainment.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(One of the enduring mysteries of the British finance lexicon is its tendency to pluralize random proper names. Goldman becomes Goldmans. Lehman becomes Lehmans. Libor becomes Libors.)</p>
<p><em>Lmfao</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hayes still didn’t grasp what had really happened. These friends who were not friends, these bosses who now claimed not to be bosses, together they had just engineered their greatest trade of all: Hayes for their own freedom. He was the genius, the university man, the millionaire, the star. And he was the fool. Most of them had their money; his would be seized. They had their liberty; he was in prison. Yes, there had been a spider network. Hayes still didn’t realize that in the end, he’d been the fly.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Golden Age of LBOs: “A few million dollars are always lost in the sands of time”]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> is a riveting look into the peak of Wall Street’s golden age of Leveraged Buyouts (some would call it the dark ages), in which ridiculous hostile takeovers and bidding wars were the norm, making CEOs, investment bankers and lawyers filthy rich.</p>
<p>The book can broadly be split into four sections: Ross Johnson’s rise, Ross Johnson’s greed, the bidding war, and the aftermath. Each of these sections has its own lessons and warnings.</p>
<p>For many years of his life, Johnson was a generic middle-management executive. Things dramatically accelerated once he became CEO of Standard Brands. Something unlocked in him, and he began to commandeer the ship, ‘merging’ with bigger fish (but consolidating power to himself). He was a master of manipulating people, though not necessarily in a bad way. He knew who you had to suck up to, and who you could disregard – a human extension of capital allocation. Then he got greedy and learnt to love an extremely lavish lifestyle. Perhaps this wasn’t entirely unjustified? Reynolds was producing massive amounts of cash, and Johnson argued that the ‘minor’ cost of having opulent dinner parties etc was more than justified by the social goodwill it generated.</p>
<p>But Johnson was always restless, looking for the next big adventure, and found it in the idea of a management buyout. The rest of <em>Barbarians</em> is about the intricate negotiations, deceptions, and double-bluffs surrounding the negotiations. It’s rather long – a good editor could probably cut down 200 pages from the book – but it’s absolutely worth it for the last 20% of the book when the bidding war comes to a climax.</p>
<p>Ego seems to be equally important to greed as a driving force on Wall Street. Many people wanted to join the bidding, not because of the potential profits, but because nobody wanted to be left out of the biggest LBO in history. Friends lied to each other to get step-ups within their own firm, trust became commoditised. The shareholders were often the last things on peoples’ minds.</p>
<p>Following the RJR debacle, Johnson was demonised by the media and ostracised by the business community. It’s hard to know if this is fair – consider the words of RJR’s former pension manager:</p>
<p>While the book, and the ultimate facts of history, seem to prove that greed was Johnson’s downfall, there’s definitely a lesson in Johnson’s story. The below quote, mocked by the authors, probably contains a pearl of valuable wisdom:</p>

<p>Johnson unloaded it for twice that, applying his usual charm and telling potential buyers how badly Nabisco had been running the business. He convinced them that Williams had worlds of unexploited potential. “I learned,” he said, “you always tell people how badly you’ve been running the goddamned company, so they’ve got some upside.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Someone had once codified the Standard Brands culture into twenty Johnsonisms. Number thirteen was “Recognize that ultimate success comes from opportunistic, bold moves which, by definition, cannot be planned.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Nabisco’s huge new research center was about to be unveiled, and Johnson, in a spasm of flattery, repaid the favor by naming it the Robert M. Schaeberle Technology Center. Schaeberle was moved. The Merry Men thought it was a brilliant way to put Schaeberle out to pasture. A man who had his name on a building, they reasoned, might as well be dead.</p>

<p>While the merger makers are often compared to mercenaries, cynics might find a more apt comparison in professional wrestling: a squad of high-priced grapplers traveling from venue to venue, leaving onlookers wondering whether all that spitting and fighting was actually for real.</p>

<p>To him Kravis was nothing less than a Wall Street Faust who sold his soul for a pile of junk bonds and a new takeover every Monday morning.</p>

<p>“It’s like Alice in Wonderland,” Forstmann would say in exasperated tones. “The reason Kravis can pay these incredible sums is that his money isn’t real. It’s phony. It’s funny money. It’s wampum. These guys are getting away with murder, and nobody knows it.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“If Ross Johnson hadn’t existed,” said Gene Hoots, RJR’s former pension manager, “it would have been necessary for Wall Street to invent him.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The zeitgeist of an age was on full display in the war for RJR: raw emotions and colliding egos; improbable plot twists and even more improbable characters.</p>

<p>In its final decade Reynolds had become less a great company than a great dream machine. Its torrent of tobacco money allowed egos to run wild and fantasies to become true. Paul Sticht could walk with kings. Ed Horrigan could live like kings. Directors could be treated like kings.</p>

<p>To Goldstone, it was clear what this tactic was about: It was what traders called a “fuck you” bid. Simply put, Cohen and Gutfreund were so mad at Kravis they wanted to shove an offer right in his face. Goldstone silently cursed these men and their giant egos.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Beattie listened with surprise as he learned Kohlberg Kravis had finished third in what was supposed to be a two-horse race.</p>

<p>Beattie would never forget the bankers’ reaction when the charade was unveiled. “You could see the dollar signs light up in their eyes,” he would recall. “It was like ‘Whooo! We’re back in the ballgame! Yeah!’”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As many lawyers do when nursing a grievance, Nusbaum knew it was important to get their anger down into writing. As Cohen and the investment bankers shouted and cursed around him, he began dictating.</div></details></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes you do just have to lock in]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I chose to read a productivity book to start 2021 because it&#39;s an area I&#39;ve been struggling with lately. For the first half of 2020, I was happy with my productivity levels, but things quickly went downhill. In between short bursts of work, I would instinctively start typing &quot;command-T-y-o-u-enter&quot; (to open YouTube). 5-minute breaks turned into half-hour time-wasting sessions.</p>
<p>The central argument of <em>Deep Work</em> is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Society now values knowledge workers – people who can integrate complex information. People who work on mundane tasks will be replaced by AI.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Success in this new economy requires &quot;deep work&quot;, i.e. long periods of uninterrupted focus.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Constantly checking social media depletes our finite resources of willpower, reducing our ability to do deep work.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Deep Work</em> was an important read. It explained to me why I was finding it so hard to get into the swing of things: having spent so much of last year giving in to procrastination, my willpower muscle atrophied. I will be adopting several ideas suggested in <em>Deep Work</em> , which I believe could improve my productivity and wellbeing in the long run. As a first step, I am going to seriously resist the urge to check my phone to pass time (e.g. when I&#39;m in a lift or waiting for someone) – while seemingly innocuous, this is the kind of thing that can weaken one&#39;s willpower over time. All this said, I was not a fan of the book.</p>
<p>Firstly, the author makes sweeping statements about the power of deep work based on a small set of anecdotes, from people working in a narrow range of activities. The author happens to be from academia, as he so often reminds us, which is highly suited to deep work. Academia is primarily an individualistic field that doesn&#39;t require much ongoing input, particularly in the author&#39;s field (computer science), so is well suited to shutting yourself away to do research. I would have liked to see a greater discussion of which areas deep work is well suited to and which it isn&#39;t. Newport mentions certain management roles as examples of where deep work <em>cannot</em> be done but doesn&#39;t analyse whether it <em>should</em> be done.</p>
<p>Secondly, Newport is very anti-tech. I agree with his points about the dangers of tech, but feel like he is missing a beat on the positives. Early on, he provided an anecdote of someone who locked himself in a room with just a programming textbook and highlighters to force himself to learn how to code. Sure, this may be &quot;deep&quot; work, but is it truly the best way to learn? Furthermore, he talks about the dangers of email and social media (I broadly agree here), but fails to recognise any of the positives, like the fact that I can converse in real time with my friends across the ocean.</p>
<p>Lastly, what is it all for? Newport vehemently argues that we should cut out social media so that we have time for &quot;the most important things in life&quot;, which in his case, seems to be churning out journal articles. The book is full of humblebragging and petty one-upping, with the author constantly reminding us about how many papers he has published etc. I understand that deep work is merely a means to achieve one&#39;s goals, but if you&#39;re going to criticise other people&#39;s lifestyle choices, it&#39;s probably worth defending your own.</p>

<p>The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. (loc 1096)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>attempting to schedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion is not an effective way to manage your limited willpower.) (loc 1120)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Knuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they’re pursuing, (loc 1136)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. (loc 1183)</p>
<p>The minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. (loc 1190)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to go deep. (loc 1221)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession. This approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t come naturally. (loc 1276)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy. (loc 1355)</p>

<p>In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. (loc 964)</p>
<p>The task of a craftsman, they conclude, “is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.” This frees the craftsman of the nihilism of autonomous individualism, providing an ordered world of meaning. (loc 977)</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Practical advice</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown. (loc 1667)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). (loc 1693)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>in addition to regularly scheduling significant blocks of time for speculative thinking and discussion, I maintain a rule that if I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day (with the exception, of course, of things that cannot be skipped). (loc 2559)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian intensity into your own workday. In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. (loc 1885)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: working with great intensity—no e-mail breaks, no daydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no repeated trips to the coffee machine. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration. (loc 1890)</p>

<p>The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. (loc 1915)</p>
<p>When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back. (loc 1939)</p>
<p>You must be on your guard for looping, as it can quickly subvert an entire productive meditation session. When you notice it, remark to yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step. (loc 1945)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.” (loc 1535)</p>
<p><em>Measure inputs (e.g how much time spent working) as well as outputs (what you produced), even if you are trying to optimise outputs)</em></div></details></p>

<p>I became ruthless in turning down time-consuming commitments and began to work more in isolated locations outside my office. I placed a tally of my deep work hours in a prominent position near my desk and got upset when it failed to grow at a fast enough rate. (loc 2963)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boesky and Milen’s dramatic rise and fall in this classic insider trading drama]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Den of Thieves</em> is set at the height of the roaring 80s, characterised by brazen corporate takeovers fuelled by cheap financing. Drexel&#39;s junk bond empire (and its king – Mike Milken) played a significant role in this: Milken&#39;s power over the junk bond market and his &quot;reality distortion field&quot; among clients allowed him to repeatedly raise billions in financing over just a weekend, providing the critical ammunition needed for mega-deals like KKR&#39;s takeover of RJR Nabisco (as told in <a href="/?books=barbarians-at-the-gate" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Barbarians at the Gate</a>). This was a capitalist utopia.</p>
<p>Underlying all this splendour, however, was widespread criminality. Milken essentially bribed clients to buy his securities, embezzled profits from them (in the form of warrants), and used his knowledge of the financings to tip-off &quot;arbitrageurs&quot; as to what deals were going through. Ivan Boesky was the king of these arbs. He is the character around which Gordon Gekko was supposedly based – in a university commencement speech, Boesky quipped &quot;Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself&quot;.</p>
<p>In a way, it is easy to feel sorry for several of the characters – many felt very guilty and were aware that what they were doing was wrong. However, they rationalised it as &quot;just this once&quot;, or &quot;I really owe him this tip&quot;. I suppose the takeaway is that these financial ethical violations are a slippery slope.</p>
<p><em>Den of Thieves</em> is a long book – too long if I&#39;m being honest. As with many of the other books in this genre, the first 200 pages are quite slow and mostly about introducing the characters and their shenanigans (though given the brazenness of the financial crime going on, this is still interesting). It does become a page-turner later on; Stewart masterfully ramps up the pace in part 2, when the dominos start falling and people start turning on each other. But it doesn&#39;t have quite the same energy and urgency as <em>Barbarians</em> .</p>

<p>Few ever got the better of Milken, because he gambled only with superior knowledge; when someone did, Milken went out and tried to hire him. (loc 767)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“There’s not enough time in the day to sit around praising each other,” Milken sharply replied. “We don’t need to talk about our successes. We only need to talk about our failures.” (loc 859)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One of his favorite pranks was to initiate heavy buying or selling about a half hour before a major market announcement, such as an antitrust court ruling that might make or break a merger deal, was due. In fact, Mulheren would have no idea about the outcome, but the sudden activity coming across the tape would suggest that he had advance knowledge. Arbs would go crazy, especially Boesky. “What did you find out?” he’d ask breathlessly. “What do you know?” “Nothing,” Mulheren would calmly reply. “I just did this to fuck people’s minds.” (loc 1500)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>After that meeting, Siegel thought of Milken as a kind of sun god. “Don’t get too close, or you’ll get burned,” (loc 4049)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Boesky just chuckled. “You’ve got to admit one thing, John,” Boesky said. “When I go, I go first class.” The next day, September 17, 1986, Boesky surrendered to federal authorities and became an undercover agent for the Department of Justice. (loc 4321)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Like a drug habit, the thrill of arbitrage success always carried with it the immediate craving for and anxiety over the next “fix,” the next takeover bid, and the need for inside information to provide the “edge.” (loc 3250)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The money and power at stake were immense; many have killed, and been killed, for less. Siegel had feared Boesky would have him killed; Boesky feared Milken would have him killed; now Mulheren had actually set out to kill Boesky. (loc 6937)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Siegel was astounded. Coming from a partner in the firm representing Continental, this sounded like inside information. He hung up the phone and gazed out over the late-spring panorama of the Connecticut coast. He knew that, in his conversation with Freeman, they had just crossed an unspoken line. He also knew that he could easily make it right by simply not acting; insider trading requires trading on the information. But he also thought that, after the embarrassing Disney loss, Freeman owed him a favor. (loc 2912)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Without his making a conscious decision, Siegel’s resolve to stop the information exchange with Freeman had eroded. Their arrangement had simply picked up where it left off. Freeman soon had ample opportunity to pay Siegel back. (loc 3164)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Siegel continued to rationalize much of what he gave Freeman as being in his clients’ interests. (loc 3211)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The parameters were simple: Drexel would plead guilty as long as Joseph and his advisors thought the firm would survive. That meant, in essence, two things: Drexel could not be perceived by its top employees as turning against Milken, and the financial burden couldn’t be so crushing as to extinguish the firm. In that event, Drexel might as well go ahead and be indicted and be forced into bankruptcy. (loc 7788)</p>

<p>A common refrain among nearly every defendant charged in the scandal was that it was unfair to single out one individual for prosecution when so many others were guilty of the same offenses, yet weren’t charged. (loc 205)</p>

<p>In an era that purported to glorify free-market capitalism, this story shows how the nation’s financial markets were in fact corrupted from within, and subverted for criminal purpose. (loc 230)</p>

<p>in a pattern that would be repeated, what appears to be insider trading became inextricably intertwined with coercing a public company into a Drexel-financed change in ownership. (loc 2021)</p>

<p>Joseph elaborated on his own philosophy: Companies should belong to those willing to take risks—in other words, to Drexel’s clients rather than to public shareholders. That’s what capitalism was all about. Anyone with Drexel’s backing could buy a company. “For the first time in history, we’ve leveled the playing field. The small can go after the big,” Joseph concluded. (loc 2130)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Milken and Boesky were deeply intertwined in what was a sweeping criminal conspiracy. Taken together, the ventures were practically a catalogue of securities crimes, starting with insider trading, and including false public disclosures, tax fraud, and market manipulation, as well as a slew of more technical crimes. What was breathtaking about the scheme, however, was not just the variety of crimes, or their frequency. It was how the crimes meshed to achieve ends more ambitious than anything even contemplated by the drafters of the securities laws. (loc 3532)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We should apply rationality to charitable giving]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Doing Good Better</em> is a definitive introduction to effective altruism, a movement (or philosophy?) that encourages the use of rational thinking to identify which altruistic activities actually do the most good.</p>
<p>Many of the results initially sound controversial: don&#39;t donate to cancer research, don&#39;t donate to disaster relief, don&#39;t (necessarily) devote your life to charity. But these conclusions logically follow if we try to systematically measure the relative cost-effectiveness of different opportunities. Your dollars can be much better spent on causes that are more neglected, or on charities that are more efficiently run. It is true that there are limits on our ability to measure quantities like the &quot;value of a human life&quot;, but part of MacAskill&#39;s point is that some charitable causes (like medicines for intestinal worms or bed-nets to prevent malaria) are factors of 100 better than others, providing a large margin of safety for quantification errors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this approach can also be applied to careers. Without seeking to offend any doctors reading this, a career in medicine (depending on your speciality) may not be as impactful as you think because there are many other doctors in the world, so your marginal impact is low. It is perfectly valid to instead choose a lucrative career and donate a portion of your income to charity.</p>
<p>As an introduction to effective altruism, MacAskill has no choice but to gloss over many of the finer ethical points in the book (though he addresses them at length elsewhere) and to occasionally resort to hyperbole. But this does not materially detract from the core message.</p>
<p>All said, <em>Doing Good Better</em> provides a fascinating new perspective on charitable giving – it might be the trigger that increases the amount of good you do in your lifetime by orders of magnitude.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Flow</em> is an in-depth look into the phenomenon of ‘optimal experience’: when you lose yourself in a task that engages your skills. One can systematically induce flow by finding tasks that are challenging and provide constant feedback, yet ones that aren’t out of your depth. An interesting point from the author is that people experience flow much more frequently at work than at home, but are loath to admit that they are more content at work despite evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>The book itself is very well researched, but I would have appreciated a slightly less academic approach - some parts are a little bit dry, and I think overall it could have been cut down by a third.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Happiness</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>is the pervasive malaise that often sours even our most precious moments the result of our seeking happiness in the wrong places?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Yet we cannot reach happiness by consciously searching for it. “Ask yourself whether you are happy,” said J. S. Mill, “and you cease to be so.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life.</p>
<p><em>One must imagine Sisyphus happy (</em> <em><a href="/?books=the-myth-of-sisyphus" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Myth of Sisyphus</a></em> <em>)</em></p>

<p>Even though we recognize that material success may not bring happiness, we engage in an endless struggle to reach external goals, expecting that they will improve life.</p>

<p>The opposite state from the condition of psychic entropy is optimal experience. When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>every flow activity, whether it involved competition, chance, or any other dimension of experience, had this in common: It provided a sense of discovery, a creative feeling of transporting the person into a new reality.</p>

<p>The family context promoting optimal experience could be described as having five characteristics. The first one is clarity: the teenagers feel that they know what their parents expect from them—goals and feedback in the family interaction are unambiguous. The second is centering, or the children’s perception that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, in their concrete feelings and experiences, rather than being preoccupied with whether they will be getting into a good college or obtaining a well-paying job. Next is the issue of choice: children feel that they have a variety of possibilities from which to choose, including that of breaking parental rules—as long as they are prepared to face the consequences. The fourth differentiating characteristic is commitment, or the trust that allows the child to feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of his defenses, and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever he is interested in. And finally there is challenge, or the parents’ dedication to provide increasingly complex opportunities for action to their children.</p>

<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorder of the mind reveals itself. With nothing to do, it begins to follow random patterns, usually stopping to consider something painful or disturbing. Unless a person knows how to give order to his or her thoughts, attention will be attracted to whatever is most problematic at the moment: it will focus on some real or imaginary pain, on recent grudges or long-term frustrations. Entropy is the normal state of consciousness—a condition that is neither useful nor enjoyable.</p>

<p>The ultimate test for the ability to control the quality of experience is what a person does in solitude, with no external demands to give structure to attention. It is relatively easy to become involved with a job, to enjoy the company of friends, to be entertained in a theater or at a concert. But what happens when we are left to our own devices? Alone, when the dark night of the soul descends, are we forced into frantic attempts to distract the mind from its coming? Or are we able to take on activities that are not only enjoyable, but make the self grow?</p>

<p>Purpose gives direction to one’s efforts, but it does not necessarily make life easier. Goals can lead into all sorts of trouble, at which point one gets tempted to give them up and find some less demanding script by which to order one’s actions. The price one pays for changing goals whenever opposition threatens is that while one may achieve a more pleasant and comfortable life, it is likely that it will end up empty and void of meaning.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note-taking that emphasises connections]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am unashamedly interested in optimising my own productivity – a key part of this is being able to absorb new content and retain it for future use. I realised long ago that reading in itself is insufficient; one needs to proactively seek to retain and contextualise new information. My solution was to make highlights while I was reading (the Kindle has been instrumental in this) and to put a little more effort into my written reviews – like this one – afterwards. This is a decent start, but it does not address the key task of making new connections and synthesising new content.</p>
<p><em>How to Take Smart Notes</em> presents the <em>zettelkasten</em> note-taking system used by Niklas Luhmann, a prominent sociologist and prolific author. The system involves keeping two &quot;boxes&quot; of notes: one containing &quot;literary notes&quot;, which summarise a resource (e.g. textbook, journal article, book) and contain bibliographic details, while the other box contains your thoughts and ideas. A key point is that you should constantly think about how your ideas link with others that you&#39;ve written about. This results in an ever-growing network of well-formed and nuanced ideas – much like a second brain. It is straightforward to then mix and match these ideas to form a piece of writing, be that an essay or a journal article.</p>
<p>What I like best is that the system is not dogmatic. Rather, it is based on intuitive principles that can be readily implemented either physically with boxes and cards, or in modern note-taking software like Notion. Ahrens emphasises that the end goal is to build a flexible system that works for you. All this said, the Luhmann system is very much geared towards academic/nonfiction writing and does not seem to be immediately applicable for people studying examination-based STEM subjects, though I will personally find it useful for my academic blog and perhaps any dissertation-related material in future.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (Dec 2021)</strong>: this book was a key spark in the renovation of my note-taking system. It&#39;s honestly hard to understate how important this has been for my development.</p>

<p>The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily? (loc 96)</p>

<p>Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. (loc 210)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. (loc 125)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In order to develop a good question to write about or find the best angle for an assignment, one must already have put some thought into a topic. To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. And the decision to read something and not something else is obviously rooted in prior understanding, and that didn’t come out of thin air, either. Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. (loc 748)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. (loc 1234)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The ability to spot patterns, to question the frames used and detect the distinctions made by others, is the precondition to thinking critically and looking behind the assertions of a text or a talk. (loc 1301)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. (loc 1319)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The attempt to rephrase an argument in our own words confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding. (loc 1325)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But there is a caveat. Even though elaboration works verifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if you just want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts (Rivard 1994). But as long as you are not striving for a career as a quiz show candidate, why would you want that, anyway? (loc 1380)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Only in the written form can an argument be looked at with a certain distance – literally. We need this distance to think about an argument – otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources we need for scrutinizing it. As (loc 1454)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with a hammer who sees nails everywhere (loc 1827)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It is the intuition that comes from the intimate knowledge of a practice that can lead us to new insights. (loc 1876)</p>

<p>When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” “No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.” (loc 1466)</p>

<p>In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? (loc 641)</p>

<p>The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. (loc 712)</p>

<p>Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing. (loc 599)</p>
<p><em>Anecdotally, this is true.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. (loc 681)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read. (loc 1141)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip. Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence. The only thing that matters is that these notes provide the best possible support for the next step, the writing of the actual slip-box notes. (loc 1173)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. This is also why this process cannot be automated or delegated to a machine or program – it requires thinking. (loc 1722)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As soon as the slip-box has grown a bit, we can replace our thoughts on what is interesting and what we think is relevant with a pragmatic look into the slip-box, where we can plainly see what truly proved to be interesting and where we found material to work with. (loc 2085)</p>

<p>Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructions. Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (loc 816)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important. (loc 840)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task. (loc 909)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill. (loc 913)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed. (loc 972)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The more experience you gain, the more you will be able to rely on your intuition to tell you what to do next. Instead of taking you “from intuition to professional writing strategies”, as the title of a typical study guide promises, it is here all about becoming a professional by acquiring the skills and experience to judge situations correctly and intuitively (loc 1039)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The brain doesn&#39;t distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. This is why David Allen’s “Getting things done” system works: The secret to have a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. (loc 1078)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Our results suggest that a broad assortment of actions make use of the same resource. Acts of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after. The implication is that some vital resource of the self becomes depleted by such acts of volition. (loc 1110)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Our brains evolved to notice details by shifting focus from one area to another, by repeatedly scanning the surroundings. [...] The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans than when it focuses.” (Zull 2002, 142f) (loc 1895)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, we become more able to actually make a genuine new contribution. (loc 2110)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When it comes to the long run, researchers struggle to find any measurable connection between our intentions and our actual behaviour (Ji and Wood 2007; Neal et al. 2012). (loc 2248)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself, not like a character trait of being “open-minded.” Those who think of themselves as being open-minded are often even more prone to stick to their first understanding as they believe to be without natural prejudices and therefore don’t see the need to counterbalance them.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We often joke that the government is listening, but rarely pause to consider the full implications of the statement. If you&#39;re not using an encrypted service, every message you write, photo you send, search history — your entire online identity — is pulled into a Google-like service that some techie in the NSA can use to learn everything about you. Snowden deftly addresses the common stupidity: “you shouldn&#39;t be worried if you don&#39;t have anything to hide”. It is unrealistic to think that you have <em>never</em> sent a message, or searched something up in google, that could be construed by a malicious prosecutor to be dubious at best, character-destroying at worst. Just because you don&#39;t have anything to say, doesn&#39;t mean that free speech is not important.</p>
<p>Prior to 2016, we perhaps would have felt confident that the keys to this &quot;absolute power&quot; would firmly be an instrument of peace and democracy, but these last few years have been a painful reminder that the processes of democracy sometimes result in leaders who seek to subvert the democratic system – PRISM gives them an immensely powerful tool to do so. I don&#39;t even want to consider the extent to which the NSA could have been used to harm democracy during the BLM riots. When you combine an all-seeing system with a President who is happy to send in a Secret Police Force, it is hard to remember whether the discussion is about a modern Western democracy or a 20th-century dictatorship.</p>
<p><em>Permanent Record</em> truly wonderful autobiography and a must-read in the era of the surveillance state: well-written, heartfelt, illuminating. I don&#39;t think that one needs to subscribe to a particular moral or political framework to find Snowden&#39;s arguments compelling. Snowden is a patriot and a hero – how else would you describe someone who exchanged a lucrative job and happy relationship for a life of exile and constant fear of a very unpleasant death at the hands of some unnamed CIA operative, all in order to inform the public of the heinous violations of their constitutional rights (with no guarantee that they&#39;d care).</p>

<p>What makes a life? More than what we say; more, even, than what we do. A life is also what we love, and what we believe in. For me, what I love and believe in the most is connection, human connection, and the technologies by which that is achieved.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I myself had sworn an oath of service not to an agency, nor even a government, but to the public, in support and defense of the Constitution, whose guarantee of civil liberties had been so flagrantly violated. Now I was more than part of that violation: I was party to it. All of that work, all of those years—who was I working for? How was I to balance my contract of secrecy with the agencies that employed me and the oath I’d sworn to my country’s founding principles? To whom, or what, did I owe the greater allegiance? At what point was I morally obliged to break the law?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I embraced the truth constructed for the good of the state, which in my passion I confused with the good of the country. It was as if whatever individual politics I’d developed had crashed—the anti-institutional hacker ethos instilled in me online, and the apolitical patriotism I’d inherited from my parents, both wiped from my system—and I’d been rebooted as a willing vehicle of vengeance.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We learn to speak by imitating the speech of the adults around us, and in the process of that learning we wind up also imitating their opinions, until we’ve deluded ourselves into thinking that the words we’re using are our own.</p>

<p>The crowds were calling for an end to oppression, censorship, and precarity. They were declaring that in a truly just society the people were not answerable to the government, the government was answerable to the people. Although each crowd in each city, even on each day, seemed to have its own specific motivation and its own specific goals, they all had one thing in common: a rejection of authoritarianism, a recommitment to the humanitarian principle that an individual’s rights are inborn and inalienable.</p>

<p>The most important decisions in life are never made that way. They’re made subconsciously and only express themselves consciously once fully formed—once you’re finally strong enough to admit to yourself that this is what your conscience has already chosen for you, this is the course that your beliefs have decreed.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A “whistleblower,” in my definition, is a person who through hard experience has concluded that their life inside an institution has become incompatible with the principles developed in—and the loyalty owed to—the greater society outside it, to which that institution should be accountable. This person knows that they can’t remain inside the institution, and knows that the institution can’t or won’t be dismantled. Reforming the institution might be possible, however, so they blow the whistle and disclose the information to bring public pressure to bear.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>American law makes no distinction between providing classified information to the press in the public interest and providing it, even selling it, to the enemy. The only opinion I’ve ever found to contradict this came from my first indoctrination into the IC: there, I was told that it was in fact slightly better to offer secrets for sale to the enemy than to offer them for free to a domestic reporter. A reporter will tell the public, whereas an enemy is unlikely to share its prize even with its allies.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I hadn’t given much thought to answering the question of what to do once the game was over, mainly because a winning conclusion was always so unlikely. All I’d cared about was getting the facts out into the world: I figured that by putting the documents into the public record, I was essentially putting myself at the public’s mercy. No exit strategy could be the only exit strategy, because any next step I might have premeditated taking would have run the risk of undermining the disclosures.</p>

<p>Now, it was the creative Web that collapsed, as countless beautiful, difficult, individualistic websites were shuttered. The promise of convenience led people to exchange their personal sites—which demanded constant and laborious upkeep—for a Facebook page and a Gmail account. The appearance of ownership was easy to mistake for the reality of it.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Back then, being online was another life, considered by most to be separate and distinct from Real Life. The virtual and the actual had not yet merged. And it was up to each individual user to determine for themselves where one ended and the other began.</p>

<p>As the millennium approached, the online world would become increasingly centralized and consolidated, with both governments and businesses accelerating their attempts to intervene in what had always been a fundamentally peer-to-peer relationship. But for one brief and beautiful stretch of time—a stretch that, fortunately for me, coincided almost exactly with my adolescence—the Internet was mostly made of, by, and for the people.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If, or rather when, one of your arguments incurred some online wrath, you could simply drop that screen name and assume another mask, under the cover of which you could even join in the mimetic pile-on, beating up on your disowned avatar as if it were a stranger. I can’t tell you what sweet relief that sometimes was.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In the 1990s, the Internet had yet to fall victim to the greatest iniquity in digital history: the move by both government and businesses to link, as intimately as possible, users’ online personas to their offline legal identity.</p>

<p>Tech people rarely, if ever, have a sense of the broader applications and policy implications of the projects to which they’re assigned. And the work that consumes them tends to require such specialized knowledge that to bring it up at a barbecue would get them disinvited from the next one, because nobody cared.</p>

<p>Technology doesn’t have a Hippocratic oath. So many decisions that have been made by technologists in academia, industry, the military, and government since at least the Industrial Revolution have been made on the basis of “can we,” not “should we.” And the intention driving a technology’s invention rarely, if ever, limits its application and use.</p>

<p>After 9/11, the IC was racked with guilt for failing to protect America, for letting the most devastating and destructive attack on the country since Pearl Harbor occur on its watch. In response, its leaders sought to build a system that would prevent them from being caught off guard ever again. At its foundation was to be technology, a foreign thing to their army of political science majors and masters of business administration. The doors to the most secretive intelligence agencies were flung wide open to young technologists like myself. And so the geek inherited the earth.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The American government, in total disregard of its founding charter, fell victim to precisely this temptation, and once it had tasted the fruit of this poisonous tree it became gripped by an unrelenting fever. In secret, it assumed the power of mass surveillance, an authority that by definition afflicts the innocent far more than the guilty.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The freedom of a country can only be measured by its respect for the rights of its citizens, and it’s my conviction that these rights are in fact limitations of state power that define exactly where and when a government may not infringe into that domain of personal or individual freedoms that during the American Revolution was called “liberty” and during the Internet Revolution is called “privacy.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The fundamental premise of the Greco-Roman pantheon always stuck with me. Up at the summit of some mountain there was this gang of gods and goddesses who spent most of their infinite existence fighting with each other and spying on the business of humanity. Occasionally, when they noticed something that intrigued or disturbed them, they disguised themselves, as lambs and swans and lions, and descended the slopes of Olympus to investigate and meddle. It was often a disaster—someone always drowned, or was struck by lightning, or was turned into a tree—whenever the immortals sought to impose their will and interfere in mortal affairs.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>That, ultimately, is the critical flaw or design defect intentionally integrated into every system, in both politics and computing: the people who create the rules have no incentive to act against themselves.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The two decades since 9/11 have been a litany of American destruction by way of American self-destruction, with the promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts, and secret wars, whose traumatizing impact—whose very existence—the US government has repeatedly classified, denied, disclaimed, and distorted.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The constitutional system only functions as a whole if and when each of its three branches works as intended. When all three don’t just fail, but fail deliberately and with coordination, the result is a culture of impunity.</p>

<p>According to the report, it was the government’s position that the NSA could collect whatever communications records it wanted to, without having to get a warrant, because it could only be said to have acquired or obtained them, in the legal sense, if and when the agency “searched for and retrieved” them from its database.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>At any time, the government could dig through the past communications of anyone it wanted to victimize in search of a crime (and everybody’s communications contain evidence of something). At any point, for all perpetuity, any new administration—any future rogue head of the NSA—could just show up to work and, as easily as flicking a switch, instantly track everybody with a phone or a computer, know who they were, where they were, what they were doing with whom, and what they had ever done in the past.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Once the ubiquity of collection was combined with the permanency of storage, all any government had to do was select a person or a group to scapegoat and go searching—as I’d gone searching through the agency’s files—for evidence of a suitable crime.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>saying that you don’t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don’t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.</p>

<p>If any of the auditors who were responsible for reviewing the searches ever bothered to look more closely, they would see only a snippet of obfuscated code, while I would be able to scroll through the most personal activities of a Supreme Court justice or a congressperson.</p>

<p>This led to the practice known as LOVEINT, a gross joke on HUMINT and SIGINT and a travesty of intelligence, in which analysts used the agency’s programs to surveil their current and former lovers along with objects of more casual affection—reading their emails, listening in on their phone calls, and stalking them online.</p>

<p>intercepted nudes were a kind of informal office currency, because his buddy kept spinning in his chair to interrupt us with a smile, saying, “Check her out,” to which my instructor would invariably reply “Bonus!” or “Nice!”</p>

<p>The unspoken transactional rule seemed to be that if you found a naked photo or video of an attractive target—or someone in communication with a target—you had to show the rest of the boys,</p>

<p>We can’t let the godlike surveillance we’re under be used to “calculate” our citizenship scores, or to “predict” our criminal activity; to tell us what kind of education we can have, or what kind of job we can have, or whether we can have an education or a job at all; to discriminate against us based on our financial, legal, and medical histories, not to mention our ethnicity or race, which are constructs that data often assumes or imposes.</div></details></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Somebody may beat me, but by God they’re going to have to bleed to do it”]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Shoe Dog</em> is probably my all-time favourite business biography – maybe even biography overall? It is a brutally honest story of Phil Knight&#39;s journey to founding Nike.</p>
<p>Even though you know that there must be a happy ending, it’s a very gripping story; I read the book in just a couple of sittings because it was impossible to put down. Knight comes startlingly close to losing everything (several times) – reminds me of Kipling: &quot;if you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss&quot;.</p>
<p>It takes a huge amount of tenacity and sacrifice to build something big. Knight (by his own admission) sometimes treated people badly and made a lot of very careless mistakes, but through a combination of unreal willpower, and the humility required to hire the right people, success found him. Cringe or cliche as it may be, the following quote truly does motivate me when times are hard.</p>
<p>I could write more of a review, but it serves no purpose. If you haven&#39;t read the book yet, my review is only wasting your time – you should read the book now. If you&#39;ve already read it, you know how good it is.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>I make no attempt to categorise the highlights below. They all deserve to go under the same subtitle: &quot;Wisdom won from the heat of battle&quot;.</em></p>
<p>There’s a kind of exuberant clarity in that pulsing half second before winning and losing are decided. I wanted that, whatever that was, to be my life, my daily life.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the geese in the rear of the formation, cruising in the backdraft, only have to work 80 percent as hard as the leaders. Every runner understands this. Front runners always work the hardest, and risk the most.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Life is growth. You grow or you die.</p>
<p><em>As Stevie likes to say, Evolve or Die.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I struggle to remember. I close my eyes and think back, but so many precious moments from those nights are gone forever. Numberless conversations, breathless laughing fits. Declarations, revelations, confidences. They’ve all fallen into the sofa cushions of time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Confidence. More than equity, more than liquidity, that’s what a man needs. I wished I had more. I wished I could borrow some. But confidence was cash. You had to have some to get some. And people were loath to give it to you.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He was Edison in Menlo Park, Da Vinci in Florence, Tesla in Wardenclyffe. Divinely inspired. I wonder if he knew, if he had any clue, that he was the Daedalus of sneakers, that he was making history, remaking an industry, transforming the way athletes would run and stop and jump for generations. I wonder if he could conceive in that moment all that he’d done. All that would follow.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>if I go out and bust my gut until I black out and somebody still beats me, and if I have made that guy reach down and use everything he has and then more, why then it just proves that on that day he’s a better man than I.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“There is one more thing,” he said. “I believe your bank has been negotiating in San Francisco to become one of Nissho’s banks?” “That’s right,” Holland said. “Ah. I must tell you that it will be a waste of your time to pursue those negotiations any further.” “Are you sure?” Holland asked. “I am quite sure.” The Ice Man cometh.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Somebody may beat me, I told myself, some banker or creditor or competitor may stop me, but by God they’re going to have to bleed to do it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The margin for error was forever getting narrower, while the stakes were forever creeping higher—and none of us wavered in the belief that “stakes” didn’t mean “money.” For some, I realize, business is the all-out pursuit of profits, period, full stop, but for us business was no more about making money than being human is about making blood.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I asked myself: What are you feeling? It wasn’t joy. It wasn’t relief. If I felt anything, it was . . . regret? Good God, I thought. Yes. Regret. Because I honestly wished I could do it all over again.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Unlike many other wise men, he drew great peace from his wisdom.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I’d like to warn the best of them, the iconoclasts, the innovators, the rebels, that they will always have a bull’s-eye on their backs. The better they get, the bigger the bull’s-eye. It’s not one man’s opinion; it’s a law of nature.</p>

        <updated>2021-12-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Superforecasting</em> is the product of Tetlock&#39;s research and experiments running a large-scale and long-running forecasting competition, from which he identified a group of individuals who <em>significantly</em> outperformed expert analysts. The book is the story behind this research and a discussion of the characteristics of these &quot;superforecasters&quot;.</p>
<p>At first, I felt that <em>Superforecasting</em> was a rehashed <a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>** (or a mix of books from that genre), but it&#39;s a wonderful book in its own right and a valuable contribution to the genre. It makes interesting philosophical points about the nature of forecasting (to parry those of NNT in <a href="/?books=the-black-swan" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Black Swan</a>); it provides rich historical examples of forecasting errors (e.g. the Bay of Pigs invasion), forecasting non-errors that were treated as errors (controversially, the existence of WMDs in Iraq), and forecasting successes (several examples of superforecaster reasoning). Most importantly, the book provides practical prescriptions for improving forecasting. All of this is wrapped in an introspective and rational package – the authors are self-aware enough to point out contentious points in their own methodology and to consider alternate views.</p>
<p>As much as I would like to paraphrase the main takeaways, I really can&#39;t do any better than the author&#39;s own summary:</p>

<p>There are countless poor street vendors in Tunisia and across the Arab world. Police corruption is rife, and humiliations like those inflicted on this man are a daily occurrence. They matter to no one aside from the police and their victims. But this particular humiliation, on December 17, 2010, caused Mohamed Bouazizi, aged twenty-six, to set himself on fire, and Bouazizi’s self-immolation sparked protests. (loc 137)</p>

<p>the actual message was garbled in the constant retelling and the subtleties were lost entirely. The message became “all expert forecasts are useless,” which is nonsense. Some variations were even cruder—like “experts know no more than chimpanzees.” My research had become a backstop reference for nihilists who see the future as inherently unpredictable and know-nothing populists who insist on preceding “expert” with “so-called.” (loc 118)</p>

<p>In the EPJ results, there were two statistically distinguishable groups of experts. The first failed to do better than random guessing, and in their longer-range forecasts even managed to lose to the chimp. The second group beat the chimp, though not by a wide margin, and they still had plenty of reason to be humble. Indeed, they only barely beat simple algorithms like “always predict no change” or “predict the recent rate of change.” Still, however modest their foresight was, they had some. (loc 1054)</p>

<p>Epistemic uncertainty is something you don’t know but is, at least in theory, knowable. If you wanted to predict the workings of a mystery machine, skilled engineers could, in theory, pry it open and figure it out. Mastering mechanisms is a prototypical clocklike forecasting challenge. Aleatory uncertainty is something you not only don’t know; it is unknowable. (loc 2217)</p>

<p>Formally, it’s called attribute substitution, but I call it bait and switch: when faced with a hard question, we often surreptitiously replace it with an easy one. “Should I worry about the shadow in the long grass?” is a hard question. Without more data, it may be unanswerable. So we substitute an easier question: “Can I easily recall a lion attacking someone from the long grass?” That question becomes a proxy for the original question and if the answer is yes to the second question, the answer to the first also becomes yes.

<p>Obviously, a forecast without a time frame is absurd. And yet, forecasters routinely make them, as they did in that letter to Ben Bernanke. They’re not being dishonest, at least not usually. Rather, they’re relying on a shared implicit understanding, however rough, of the timeline they have in mind. That’s why forecasts without timelines don’t appear absurd when they are made. But as time passes, memories fade, and tacit time frames that once seemed obvious to all become less so. (loc 848)</p>

<p>Disturbed, Kent went back to his team. They had all agreed to use “serious possibility” in the NIE so Kent asked each person, in turn, what he thought it meant.

<p>Foresight isn’t a mysterious gift bestowed at birth. It is the product of particular ways of thinking, of gathering information, of updating beliefs. These habits of thought can be learned and cultivated by any intelligent, thoughtful, determined person. (loc 313)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>superforecasting demands thinking that is open-minded, careful, curious, and—above all—self-critical. It also demands focus. The kind of thinking that produces superior judgment does not come effortlessly. Only the determined can deliver it reasonably consistently, which is why our analyses have consistently found commitment to self-improvement to be the strongest predictor of performance. (loc 347)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Scientists must be able to answer the question “What would convince me I am wrong?” If they can’t, it’s a sign they have grown too attached to their beliefs. (loc 632)</p>

And the foxes didn’t just win by acting like chickens, playing it safe with 60% and 70% forecasts where hedgehogs boldly went with 90% and 100%. Foxes beat hedgehogs on both calibration and resolution. Foxes had real foresight. (loc 1078)</p>

<p>dragonflies have two eyes, but theirs are constructed very differently. Each eye is an enormous, bulging sphere, the surface of which is covered with tiny lenses. Depending on the species, there may be as many as thirty thousand of these lenses on a single eye, each one occupying a physical space slightly different from those of the adjacent lenses, giving it a unique perspective.

<p>The humility required for good judgment is not self-doubt—the sense that you are untalented, unintelligent, or unworthy. It is intellectual humility. It is a recognition that reality is profoundly complex, that seeing things clearly is a constant struggle, when it can be done at all, and that human judgment must therefore be riddled with mistakes.

<p>Magnus Carlsen respects his intuition, as well he should, but he also does a lot of “double-checking” because he knows that sometimes intuition can let him down and conscious thought can improve his judgment. (loc 721)</p>

<p>Superforecasters pursue point-counterpoint discussions routinely (loc 1927)</p>

<p>look at how foxes approach forecasting. They deploy not one analytical idea but many and seek out information not from one source but many. Then they synthesize it all into a single conclusion. In a word, they aggregate. (loc 1156)</p>

<p>If you aimlessly examine one tree, then another, and another, you will quickly become lost in the forest. A good exploration of the inside view does not involve wandering around, soaking up any and all information and hoping that insight somehow emerges. It is targeted and purposeful: it is an investigation, not an amble.11 (loc 1855)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Researchers have found that merely asking people to assume their initial judgment is wrong, to seriously consider why that might be, and then make another judgment, produces a second estimate which, when combined with the first, improves accuracy almost as much as getting a second estimate from another person.13 The same effect was produced simply by letting several weeks pass before asking people to make a second estimate. This approach, built on the “wisdom of the crowd” concept, has been called “the crowd within.” (loc 1901)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There is an even simpler way of getting another perspective on a question: tweak its wording. (loc 1907)</p>

<p>superforecasters often tackle questions in a roughly similar way—one that any of us can follow: Unpack the question into components. Distinguish as sharply as you can between the known and unknown and leave no assumptions unscrutinized. Adopt the outside view and put the problem into a comparative perspective that downplays its uniqueness and treats it as a special case of a wider class of phenomena. Then adopt the inside view that plays up the uniqueness of the problem. Also explore the similarities and differences between your views and those of others—and pay special attention to prediction markets and other methods of extracting wisdom from crowds. Synthesize all these different views into a single vision as acute as that of a dragonfly. Finally, express your judgment as precisely as you can, using a finely grained scale of probability.

<p>If her forecasting is perfect, rain happens 70% of the time when she says there is 70% chance of rain, 30% of the time when she says there is 30% chance of rain, and so on. This is called calibration. It can be plotted on a simple chart. (loc 966)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Important as calibration is, it’s not the whole story because “perfect calibration” isn’t what we think of when we imagine perfect forecasting accuracy. Perfection is godlike omniscience. It’s saying “this will happen” and it does, or “this won’t happen” and it doesn’t. The technical term for this is “resolution.” (loc 978)</p>

<p>The math behind this system was developed by Glenn W. Brier in 1950, hence results are called Brier scores. In effect, Brier scores measure the distance between what you forecast and what actually happened. (loc 997)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Imagine you get a couple of hundred ordinary people to forecast geopolitical events. You see how often they revise their forecasts and how accurate those forecasts prove to be and use that information to identify the forty or so who are the best. Then you have everyone make lots more forecasts. This time, you calculate the average forecast of the whole group—“the wisdom of the crowd”—but with extra weight given to those forty top forecasters. Then you give the forecast a final tweak: You “extremize” it, meaning you push it closer to 100% or zero. If the forecast is 70% you might bump it up to, say, 85%. If it’s 30%, you might reduce it to 15%. (loc 1399)</p>

<p>When you combine the judgments of a large group of people to calculate the “wisdom of the crowd” you collect all the relevant information that is dispersed among all those people. But none of those people has access to all that information. One person knows only some of it, another knows some more, and so on. What would happen if every one of those people were given all the information? They would become more confident—raising their forecasts closer to 100% or zero. If you then calculated the “wisdom of the crowd” it too would be more extreme. Of course it’s impossible to give every person all the relevant information—so we extremize to simulate what would happen if we could. (loc 1410)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read this many years ago and was wowed by it. NNT sincerely believes that he has a deep understanding of the world that few others have – a prophet whose wisdom will allow the lucky reader to ascend beyond the group-thinking apes. However, having witnessed NNT&#39;s pugnacious behaviour on various Twitter debates, I had become quite disillusioned about him. This is all to say that I started this re-read with a lot more scepticism (but hopefully more intellectual maturity).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll start with the negatives. The book devotes many pages to various disorganised philosophical thoughts, which seem like they are there largely to remind the reader that NNT is a true renaissance man, whose bedtime reading consists of Montaigne, Poincare, Hume. His tone reminds me of Charles Kinbote, the &quot;protagonist&quot; of Nabokov&#39;s <em>Pale Fire</em> . What irritates me most, however, is a deep hypocrisy in the book. NNT strongly criticises the narrative fallacy – the tendency for humans to create an explanative story for what is actually a random sequence of events – yet at the same time presents a lot of his thinking in the form of anecdotes. NNT recognises as much, stating &quot;There is a contradiction; this book is a story, and I prefer to use stories and vignettes to illustrate our gullibility about stories and our preference for the dangerous compression of narratives&quot;, but the recognition of it does not mitigate its existence.</p>
<p>He seems to believe that this disclaimer gives him license to make many assertions about the nature of black swans. I don&#39;t doubt that black swans play a large role in history, but there is a big gap between that and conceding that most/all prediction is doomed to failure. The result of this contradiction is that what NNT says may be true – and in fact, I am inclined to agree with the importance of tail events – but as it stands, the book is as unscientific as the works he so vociferously criticises.</p>
<p>Just like there&#39;s a fast brain and a slow brain (<a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>), there seems to be an NNT the thinker and NNT the disparager. His thoughts on black swans are insightful and semi-original, but he unfortunately interleaves this with vehement and callous criticism towards every other field, especially the social sciences. For all of the intellectual humility that NNT pretends to have, he accuses other fields of making sweeping generalisations while himself doing the same – a veritable strawman factory.</p>
<p>Now if you&#39;ve read my review this far, it may seem that I had a very negative experience reading the book. One of the core themes is that of &quot;fat tails&quot;, or the 80/20 principle, in which the majority of the outcome is explained by a small fraction of the inputs. It is a deep irony that I found this book to obey the same 80/20 principle: a few lessons are so valuable that they justify slogging through what can otherwise be an annoying read (due to NNT&#39;s pretentious toxicity). Chapter 13 and the technical chapters on Prediction (14+) were excellent, but even the nontechnical ideas are immensely valuable for anyone who wants to call themselves a rationalist.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Absence of evidence is NOT the same as evidence of absence</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Make decisions that give you positive (convex) exposure: limited downside with potentially massive upside.

<p>I stop and summarize the triplet: rarity, extreme impact, and retrospective (though not prospective) predictability.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Any reduction of the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the supreme law of Mediocristan as follows: When your sample is large, no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or the total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but eventually insignificant, to the sum.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Mediocristan is where we must endure the tyranny of the collective, the routine, the obvious, and the predicted; Extremistan is where we are subjected to the tyranny of the singular, the accidental, the unseen, and the unpredicted.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Some events can be rare and consequential, but somewhat predictable, particularly to those who are prepared for them and have the tools to understand them (instead of listening to statisticians, economists, and charlatans of the bell-curve variety). They are near–Black Swans. They are somewhat tractable scientifically—knowing about their incidence should lower your surprise; these events are rare but expected. I call this special case of “gray” swans Mandelbrotian randomness.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It is worth mentioning here that one of the mistakes people make in the interpretation of the Black Swan idea is that they believe that Black Swans are more frequent than in our imagination. Not quite the point. Black Swans are more consequential, not necessarily more frequent. There are actually fewer remote events, but they are more and more extreme in their impact, which confuses people, as they tend to write them off more easily.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In general, positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly—it is much easier and much faster to destroy than to build.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Platonicity: the focus on those pure, well-defined, and easily discernible objects like triangles, or more social notions like friendship or love, at the cost of ignoring those objects of seemingly messier and less tractable structures.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>What is called ontological (or ontic) uncertainty, as opposed to epistemic, is the type of randomness where the future is not implied by the past (or not even implied by anything). It is created every minute by the complexity of our actions, which makes the uncertainty much more fundamental than the epistemic one coming from imperfections in knowledge.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>History</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what’s inside the box, how the mechanisms work. What I call the generator of historical events is different from the events themselves, much as the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds. You are very likely to be fooled about their intentions.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>History and societies do not crawl. They make jumps. They go from fracture to fracture, with a few vibrations in between. Yet we (and historians) like to believe in the predictable, small incremental progression.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The historian Niall Ferguson showed that, despite all the standard accounts of the buildup to the Great War, which describe “mounting tensions” and “escalating crises,” the conflict came as a surprise. Only retrospectively was it seen as unavoidable by backward-looking historians. Ferguson used a clever empirical argument to make his point: he looked at the prices of imperial bonds, which normally include investors’ anticipation of government’s financing needs and decline in expectation of conflicts since wars cause severe deficits. But bond prices did not reflect the anticipation of war.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Another fallacy in the way we understand events is that of silent evidence. History hides both Black Swans and its Black Swan–generating ability from us.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I am not saying causes do not exist; do not use this argument to avoid trying to learn from history. All I am saying is that it is not so simple; be suspicious of the “because” and handle it with care—particularly in situations where you suspect silent evidence.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I know that history is going to be dominated by an improbable event, I just don’t know what that event will be.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>History is useful for the thrill of knowing the past, and for the narrative (indeed), provided it remains a harmless narrative. One should learn under severe caution. History is certainly not a place to theorize or derive general knowledge, nor is it meant to help in the future, without some caution. We can get negative confirmation from history, which is invaluable, but we get plenty of illusions of knowledge along with it.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Forecasting and statistics</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>How can we know the future, given knowledge of the past; or, more generally, how can we figure out properties of the (infinite) unknown based on the (finite) known?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Now, there are other themes arising from our blindness to the Black Swan: We focus on preselected segments of the seen and generalize from it to the unseen: the error of confirmation. We fool ourselves with stories that cater to our Platonic thirst for distinct patterns: the narrative fallacy. We behave as if the Black Swan does not exist: human nature is not programmed for Black Swans. What we see is not necessarily all that is there. History hides Black Swans from us and gives us a mistaken idea about the odds of these events: this is the distortion of silent evidence. We “tunnel”: that is, we focus on a few well-defined sources of uncertainty, on too specific a list of Black Swans (at the expense of the others that do not easily come to mind).</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>someone who observed the turkey’s first thousand days (but not the shock of the thousand and first) would tell you, and rightly so, that there is no evidence of the possibility of large events, i.e., Black Swans. You are likely to confuse that statement, however, particularly if you do not pay close attention, with the statement that there is evidence of no possible Black Swans.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Let’s say economists predict inflation; in response to these expectations the Federal Reserve acts and lowers inflation. So you cannot judge the forecast accuracy in economics as you would with other events. I agree with this point, but I do not believe that it is the cause of the economists’ failure to predict. The world is far too complicated for their discipline.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Poincaré wrote that one of his friends, an unnamed “eminent physicist,” complained to him that physicists tended to use the Gaussian curve because they thought mathematicians believed it a mathematical necessity; mathematicians used it because they believed that physicists found it to be an empirical fact.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you’re dealing with qualitative inference, such as in psychology or medicine, looking for yes/no answers to which magnitudes don’t apply, then you can assume you’re in Mediocristan without serious problems. The impact of the improbable cannot be too large.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Modelers were forced to spend their time writing theories on possible models that generate the scalable—as if they needed to be apologetic about it. Theory shmeory! I have an epistemological problem with that, with the need to justify the world’s failure to resemble an idealized model that someone blind to reality has managed to promote.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I am skeptical about confirmation—though only when errors are costly—not about disconfirmation. Having plenty of data will not provide confirmation, but a single instance can disconfirm. I am skeptical when I suspect wild randomness, gullible when I believe that randomness is mild.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The lesson for the small is: be human! Accept that being human involves some amount of epistemic arrogance in running your affairs. Do not be ashamed of that. Do not try to always withhold judgment—opinions are the stuff of life. Do not try to avoid predicting—yes, after this diatribe about prediction I am not urging you to stop being a fool. Just be a fool in the right places.* What you should avoid is unnecessary dependence on large-scale harmful predictions—those and only those. Avoid the big subjects that may hurt your future: be fooled in small matters, not in the large. Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictors in social science (they are mere entertainers), but do make your own forecast for the picnic. By all means, demand certainty for the next picnic; but avoid government social-security forecasts for the year 2040. Know how to rank beliefs not according to their plausibility but by the harm they may cause.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Also when I was railing against models, social scientists kept repeating that they knew it and that there is a saying, “all models are wrong, but some are useful”—not understanding that the real problem is that “some are harmful.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Assume that you live in a town with two hospitals—one large, the other small. On a given day 60 percent of those born in one of the two hospitals are boys. Which hospital is it likely to be? Many statisticians made the equivalent of the mistake (during a casual conversation) of choosing the larger hospital, when in fact the very basis of statistics is that large samples are more stable and should fluctuate less from the long-term average—here, 50 percent for each of the sexes—than smaller samples.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In quant trading, the same amount of work is involved in buying a hundred shares as in buying a hundred thousand, or even a million. It is the same phone call, the same computation, the same legal document, the same expenditure of brain cells, the same effort in verifying that the transaction is right.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>So from a narrowly defined accounting point of view, which I may call here “hedonic calculus,” it does not pay to shoot for one large win. Mother Nature destined us to derive enjoyment from a steady flow of pleasant small, but frequent, rewards. As I said, the rewards do not have to be large, just frequent—a little bit here, a little bit there. Consider that our major satisfaction for thousands of years came in the form of food and water (and something else more private), and that while we need these steadily, we quickly reach saturation.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you engage in a Black Swan–dependent activity, it is better to be part of a group.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>People often accept that a financial strategy with a small chance of success is not necessarily a bad one as long as the success is large enough to justify it. For a spate of psychological reasons, however, people have difficulty carrying out such a strategy, simply because it requires a combination of belief, a capacity for delayed gratification, and the willingness to be spat upon by clients without blinking.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>make a distinction between positive contingencies and negative ones. Learn to distinguish between those human undertakings in which the lack of predictability can be (or has been) extremely beneficial and those where the failure to understand the future caused harm. There are both positive and negative Black Swans.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>when you have a very limited loss you need to get as aggressive, as speculative, and sometimes as “unreasonable” as you can be.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Lottery-ticket fallacy: the naïve analogy equating an investment in collecting positive Black Swans to the accumulation of lottery tickets. Lottery tickets are not scalable.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Remember that positive Black Swans have a necessary first step: you need to be exposed to them. Many people do not realize that they are getting a lucky break in life when they get it. If a big publisher (or a big art dealer or a movie executive or a hotshot banker or a big thinker) suggests an appointment, cancel anything you have planned: you may never see such a window open up again. I am sometimes shocked at how little people realize that these opportunities do not grow on trees. Collect as many free nonlottery tickets (those with open-ended payoffs) as you can, and, once they start paying off, do not discard them. Work hard, not in grunt work, but in chasing such opportunities and maximizing exposure to them.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One frequent confusion: people believe that I am suggesting that agents should bet on Black Swans taking place, when I am saying that they should avoid blowing up should a Black Swan take place.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Invest in preparedness, not in prediction. Remember that infinite vigilance is just not possible.</p>

<p>In the end this is a trivial decision making rule: I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans—when a failure would be of small moment—and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan. I am very aggressive when an error in a model can benefit me, and paranoid when the error can hurt.</p>

Cabdrivers did not believe that they understood as much as learned people—really, they were not the experts and they knew it.

<p>I wanted to become a flâneur, a professional meditator, sit in cafés, lounge, unglued to desks and organization structures, sleep as long as I needed, read voraciously, and not owe any explanation to anybody. I wanted to be left alone in order to build, small steps at a time, an entire system of thought based on my Black Swan idea.</p>

<p>Knowledge, even when it is exact, does not often lead to appropriate actions because we tend to forget what we know, or forget how to process it properly if we do not pay attention, even when we are experts.

<p>Talk is cheap.

<p>Hume was jovial and a bon vivant, eager for literary fame, salon company, and pleasant conversation. His life was not devoid of anecdotes. He once fell into a swamp near the house he was building in Edinburgh. Owing to his reputation among the locals as an atheist, a woman refused to pull him out of it until he recited the Lord’s Prayer and the Belief, which, being practical-minded, he did. But not before he argued with her about whether Christians were obligated to help their enemies.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What is most remarkable about the story behind Amazon is the extent to which Bezos was consistently pulling forward the whole company – he consistently had the most grandiose vision for Amazon and had the animus to execute it.</p>
<p>However, separating the source material from the telling of it, I must say that I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the biography as written. It was convoluted, jumping back and forth in time with no clear purpose; ideas/themes were introduced then taken no further. After finishing the book and writing this review, I was interested to read that Mackenzie Bezos (now Scott) was highly critical of the book, suggesting that Stone frequently presents his view of Bezos&#39;s state of mind as fact, while in reality, he never interviewed Bezos for the book. It is hard to know who to side with – both Mackenzie and this author have biases pulling in different directions, but even without this question mark over the factual content, the biography is mediocre at best.</p>
<p>For anyone looking for a business memoir, I would categorically recommend <a href="/?books=shoe-dog" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Shoe Dog</a> instead.</p>

<p>Bezos never showed anxiety or appeared to worry about the wild swings in public sentiment. “We were all running around the halls with our hair on fire thinking, What are we going to do?” says Mark Britto, a senior vice president. But not Jeff. “I have never seen anyone so calm in the eye of a storm. Ice water runs through his veins,” (loc 1495)</p>

<p>“If you look at why Amazon is so different than almost any other company that started early on the Internet, it’s because Jeff approached it from the very beginning with that long-term vision,” (loc 4963)</p>

<p>“Jeff does a couple of things better than anyone I’ve ever worked for,” Dalzell says. “He embraces the truth. A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time. “The second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking. What is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.” (loc 3920)</p>

<p>“We are genuinely customer-centric, we are genuinely long-term oriented and we genuinely like to invent. Most companies are not those things. They are focused on the competitor, rather than the customer. They want to work on things that will pay dividends in two or three years, and if they don’t work in two or three years they will move on to something else. And they prefer to be close-followers rather than inventors, (loc 153)</p>

<p>you should wake up worried, terrified every morning,” he told his employees. “But don’t be worried about our competitors because they’re never going to send us any money anyway. Let’s be worried about our customers and stay heads-down focused.” (loc 828)</p>

<p>Lower prices led to more customer visits. More customers increased the volume of sales and attracted more commission-paying third-party sellers to the site. That allowed Amazon to get more out of fixed costs like the fulfillment centers and the servers needed to run the website. This greater efficiency then enabled it to lower prices further.

<p>Bezos predicted they would be good over the long term but said that he didn’t want to repeat “Steve Jobs’s mistake” of pricing the iPhone in a way that was so fantastically profitable that the smartphone market became a magnet for competition. (loc 3282)</p>

<p>As suppliers had learned over the past decade, no matter the category, Amazon wielded its market power neither lightly nor gracefully, employing every bit of leverage to improve its own margins and pass along savings to its customers. If the company didn’t get what it wanted, the reaction could be severe. (loc 4100)</p>

<p>insiders were once again left with their mouths agape, marveling at how Bezos had ruthlessly engineered another acquisition by driving his target off a cliff.

<p>“Their systems were programmed in such a way that you didn’t have to receive ten books, you only had to order ten books.

<p>He gave Blue Origin a coat of arms and a Latin motto, Gradatim Ferociter, which translates to “Step by Step, Ferociously.” The phrase accurately captures Amazon’s guiding philosophy as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Postrational reflections on personal finance]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Psychology of Money</em> has been widely recommended to me, both by the podcasts I follow as well as friends who are interested in investing. This is not a book about finance. Rather, it is a book containing observations regarding our relationship with money. With &quot;psychology&quot; in the title, I was expecting something more Kahneman-esque, with a focus on behavioural biases and how these lead to different investor performances. Instead, the book presents a more narrative-based discussion of various topics – perhaps &quot;The Psychoanalysis of Money&quot; might be a more apt title. The book is very quotable, but one gets the impression that it has been written to generate these quotes rather than as a cohesive flowing read.</p>
<p>All these negatives aside, <em>The Psychology of Money</em> is a short, gentle book that contains valuable lessons about personal finance. I don&#39;t agree with all of Housel&#39;s views and I think that people who have read several books about behavioural finance will find this book to be basic, but for most people, it is worth a read – the chapters are about 5-10 minutes long and can be read independently of each other.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Success Equation</em> is a gentle book about the difference between luck and skill. There are probably more comprehensive books on the subject, focussing on financial markets (e.g <em>Fooled by Randomness</em> ), general decision-making (<a href="/?books=superforecasting" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Superforecasting</a>), or psychology (<a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>), but Mauboussin&#39;s book is a good (if slightly diffuse) overview that highlights the relevant findings.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy concept in the book is that the rate of mean reversion depends on the relative importance of luck and skill. For skill-based activities, like chess, past success is a good predictor of future success, whereas in &quot;wicked domains&quot; (like markets), there is a good reason for the standard caveat that &quot;past performance is not indicative of future results&quot;.</p>

<p>In activities where luck is more important, the base rate should guide your prediction. (loc 161)</p>

<p>Professor Gregory Northcraft, a psychologist at the University of Illinois, sums it up: “There are a lot of areas where people who have experience think they&#39;re experts, but the difference is that experts have predictive models, and people who have experience have models that aren&#39;t necessarily predictive.” (loc 411)</p>

<p>In one experiment, Gazzaniga showed a split-brain patient two cards with images on them. The patient&#39;s left eye (controlled by the right hemisphere) saw a snowy scene. The patient&#39;s right eye (controlled by the left hemisphere) saw a chicken&#39;s foot. When asked to pick a card that related to what he saw, the patient picked a shovel with his left hand (right hemisphere) and a chicken with his right hand (left hemisphere). In other words, each hemisphere independently came up with an appropriate response. For example, the right hemisphere correctly chose something related to what it had seen: a snow shovel for the snow. However, in most people, the right hemisphere has no ability to express language. And all the left hemisphere knew about was a chicken&#39;s foot and the image of a shovel that it inexplicably chose. How could he resolve the conflict? Make up a story. When the researchers asked the patient why he picked what he did, the interpreter in the left brain kicked into gear: “Oh, that&#39;s simple. The chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed.” Rather than saying, “I don&#39;t know,” the left hemisphere made up a response based on what it knew.

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Diaspora by Greg Egan]]></title>

        <updated>2021-12-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Diaspora</em> is another masterpiece from Greg Egan. The premise: a future where humanity has split into fleshers (biological humans), gleisners (humans who have uploaded themselves into robotic bodies), and purely digital consciousnesses. Rather than being about the sociocultural interactions between these factions (like <em>Bladerunner</em> , or Asimov&#39;s <em>I Robot</em> ), <em>Diaspora</em> is much more about the long term progress of humanity – how we might be able to overcome the challenges of an unforgiving universe.</p>
<p>For anyone remotely interested in AI, I would <strong>highly</strong> recommend that you set aside 15 minutes with a cup of tea to read the first chapter (which has been published as a standalone short story called <em>Orphanogenesis</em> ). It is an incredible take on AI, aiming to capture the <em>qualia</em> of learning from the perspective of a &quot;conscious AI&quot;, which makes it a nice complement to the factual accounts in a book like <a href="/?books=how-to-create-a-mind" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">How to Create a Mind</a> (or the work of Marvin Minsky).</p>
<p>There is a big &quot;but&quot;. While I have no intention of gatekeeping Egan&#39;s work, my honest perspective is that this book would be far less enjoyable for someone without a university-level understanding of (astro)physics. Without giving away too much, one of the plot points is an unstable astrophysical system; unlike other authors who might cheat and say &quot;the system was unstable&quot;, Egan (through the eyes of a character) explores what the telescopes / gravitational wave detectors would actually show if the system were indeed unstable, and tries to hypothesise <em>physical</em> mechanisms. Another motif is Kozuch theory, a (fictional) grand-unified theory (combining general relativity and quantum mechanics), which Egan verbally sketches out.</p>
<p>This is what makes Egan unique (and why I find his books so hard to put down), but it&#39;s a significant barrier to entry (<em>Diaspora</em> is tricky even by Egan standards – try <a href="/?books=permutation-city" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Permutation City</a> for something marginally more accessible). Despite learning General Relativity at university, I still found some of the discussions about manifold curvature tough to follow. I suppose one could enjoy <em>Diaspora</em> without following the physics, but it somewhat defeats the point – better to just read PK Dick in that case (if you do want a taste of Egan, his short stories are easier).</p>
<p>All this is highly unfortunate because the concepts are mind-blowing. From the philosophical questions about what it means to be conscious, to the &quot;big-picture&quot; questions about humanity&#39;s place in the universe, every page is a delight. I was disappointed with the ending and was initially tempted to notch down my review from 5 stars to 4 stars. On reflection, I realised that my disappointment was less to do with the resolution of the plot and more to do with the fact that I, as a reader, could no longer inhabit the world of the book. This sentiment is incompatible with my pessimistic view of humanity&#39;s long term potential (see my review to <a href="/?books=the-precipice" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Precipice</a>). Though I am yet to internally resolve this contradiction, this may end up being one of the few Egan works that has improved my outlook for humanity (most have a distinct nihilist/antihumanist flair).</p>

<p>In many polises, new citizens weren’t grown at all; they were assembled directly from generic subsystems. But the Konishi method provided a certain quasi-biological robustness, a certain seamlessness. Systems grown together, interacting even as they were being formed, resolved most kinds of potential mismatch themselves, with no need for an external mind-builder to fine-tune all the finished components to ensure that they didn’t clash.

<p>A citizen who spiraled down into insanity could spend teratau in a state of confusion and pain, with a mind too damaged to authorize help, or even to choose extinction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trump’s 2016 win was a surprise for him, and he was woefully unprepared]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Fifth Risk</em> is about the inadequacy of Trump but is presented in a refreshingly apolitical way. It follows the careers of three scientists who, at the time of Trump&#39;s inauguration, were near the top of their respective agencies in government. These are three rational and very competent individuals, who had achieved significant success in industry/academia before deciding to work &quot;for the greater good&quot; in the government and handled extremely complex projects during previous administrations.</p>
<p>When one president hands over to the next, all of the agencies prepare a huge set of handover-takeover resources so that the next government can pick up where the previous left off. The government agencies diligently did so, but to their surprise, in many cases, the Trump administration didn&#39;t send anyone to receive the resources. When people were sent, they were hopelessly incompetent bureaucrats chosen for no other reason than loyalty to Trump. From Lewis&#39; telling of it, it&#39;s quite a surprise that there haven&#39;t been any catastrophic government accidents since 2016.</p>
<p>On a side note, it was quite interesting to read about the complexity of the US government and the number of departments they have. Boring names, such as the Department of Agriculture, have their fingers in surprisingly many pots.</p>
<p><em>The Fifth Risk</em> is a short read, and definitely worth the time. I would have appreciated a little bit more of a thesis to tie together the three strands, but even without them, Lewis&#39; many small references to Trump&#39;s handling of the executive handover paint quite a worrying picture. The next president is going to have quite a rough time cleaning up the mess.</p>
<hr>
<p>Perry is of course responsible for one of the DOE’s most famous moments—when in a 2011 presidential debate he said he intended to eliminate three entire departments of the federal government. Asked to list them he named Commerce, Education, and . . . then hit a wall. “The third agency of government I would do away with . . . Education . . . the . . . ahhhh . . . ahhh . . . Commerce, and let’s see.” As his eyes bored a hole in his lectern, his mind drew a blank. “I can’t, the third one. I can’t. Sorry. Oops.” (loc 327)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>when I had asked him for the fifth risk, he had thought about it and then seemed to relax a bit. The fifth risk did not put him at risk of revealing classified information. “Project management,” was all he said. (loc 577)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If your ambition is to maximize short-term gain without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing the cost. (loc 671)</p>

<p>It was an open question as to which was more mysterious to a male NASA engineer: outer space or the American female. (loc 1341)</p>

        <link href="https://reads.reasonabledeviations.com/?books=the-precipice"/>
        <updated>2021-12-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are playing Russian roulette with our existence]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Precipice</em> argues that we need to pay attention to existential risks (Xrisks) – events that, in the author&#39;s words, would prevent humanity from achieving its long term potential. What makes these difficult to reason about is that these events have very low probability (evidenced by the fact that we are still here) but immense consequences. Humans are rather bad at reasoning about day-to-day probabilistic events, let alone events with this character.</p>
<p>The book is exceedingly well-written: methodical without being robotic. Ord takes us through several key Xrisks, including natural ones like the K-T meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, as well as anthropogenic risks – an important point in the book is that the latter is the dominant contributor to the total risk. It&#39;s appalling how close we came to nuclear war during the Cuban Missle Crisis, and how little progress has been made since. We now also have to worry about the risks of rogue AI, bioengineered pandemics, and perhaps the scariest: risks that we haven&#39;t yet thought of. <a href="/?books=the-fifth-risk" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Fifth Risk</a> by Michael Lewis gives some nice perspective on the mishandling of Xrisk under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Ord believes that the main reason Xrisk is important is that humanity has a huge amount of potential in the long run – we will eventually reach out to the stars, and accomplish wonderful things. Ord bleeds with hope and optimism; I get strong Asimov vibes: &quot;the end of Eternity – and the beginning of Infinity&quot; (this quote will only make sense if you&#39;ve read <em>The End of Eternity</em> ).</p>
<p>Maybe I am just a pessimist, but this is the part of the book that I am personally most ambivalent about. It&#39;s not self-evident to me that the long term future of humanity is so important. Some Buddhist scholars liken Nirvana to non-existence; under that philosophy, a transition from existence to non-existence (like humanity getting instantly vaporised by a gamma-ray burst) wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing – though forgive me if I am misunderstanding and misconstruing Buddhist philosophy. Ord mentions that he also went through a similar phase but grew out of it; perhaps that will happen to me one day. For now, my belief is nicely summarised by Jan Narveson (mentioned in the appendix): I am &quot;in favour of making people happy, but neutral about making happy people&quot;.</p>
<p>In any case, even if I were strongly committed to this somewhat nihilist way of thinking, Xrisk would still be worth paying attention to. I do care about the suffering of people currently in existence, and many Xrisks would lead to gruesome levels of suffering on a global scale: not a clean mathematical transition from existence to non-existence.</p>
<p>This has been a long review, but my takeaway is that <em>The Precipice</em> is a necessary read. It is quite short and very well-written (the page count is misleading because literally half the book is made of footnotes). I&#39;ll leave you to form your own judgments about the long-term value of humanity.</p>

<p>Our abiding image of space travel should not be the comfort and ease of an ocean liner, but the ingenuity, daring and perseverance of the Polynesian sailors who, a thousand years ago, sailed vast stretches of the Pacific to find all its scattered islands and complete the final stage of the settlement of the Earth. Seen in this way—as a grand challenge for humanity—I can’t help but think that if we last long enough, we would be able to settle our nearest stars. (loc 3732)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A brilliant introduction to the nascent field of complexity science – Mitchell does a fantastic job of illuminating the (brief) history of the subject and exploring the central tenets, however fluid they may be. This book is an excellent companion to <em>Gödel Escher Bach.</em></p>
<p>Complexity shows up in diverse fields like physics, economics, biology, and computer science. One of the most fascinating things is self-reference, for example, DNA not only contains the instructions for how to build proteins, but it also contains instructions to build a parser (the ribosomes) for itself.</p>
<p>Mitchell is clearly an experienced scientist, and this comes through in the way she discusses the material: nothing is presented as &#39;the truth&#39; – even for the work of scientists whom Mitchell clearly respects, she provides a very balanced view and well-intentioned criticism. There is a good amount of anecdote (maybe even a little bit on the low side) and the book is highly readable, especially given the difficulty of some of the concepts (e.g. Turing’s undecidability).</p>
<p>I find it interesting that Mitchell alludes to the fact that the current academic field of Complex Systems itself is very much similar to a pre-emergent complex system, where there are many individual undercurrents but currently lacking a new generation to demonstrate a cohesive narrative. It’s a tempting pitch to someone at the start of their career!</p>

<p>The word complex comes from the Latin root plectere: to weave, entwine. In complex systems, many simple parts are irreducibly entwined, and the field of complexity is itself an entwining of many different fields. (loc 216)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>complex system: a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution. (loc 335)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If the sciences of complexity are to become a unified science of complexity, then people are going to have to figure out how these diverse notions—formal and informal—are related to one another, and how to most usefully refine the overly complex notion of complexity. (loc 1673)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>This is the nature of science—an endless cycle of proud proposing and disdainful doubting. (loc 5009)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We use words such as complexity, self-organization, and emergence to represent phenomena common to the systems in which we’re interested but we can’t yet characterize the commonalities in a more rigorous way. (loc 5132)</p>
<p><em>We are approaching a phenomenology of complexity, but not a true</em> **<em>theory</em> **</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Newton believed he could marshal a complete science of motion, if only he could find the appropriate lexicon.…</p>
<p>Can we similarly invent the calculus of complexity—a mathematical language that captures the origins and dynamics of self-organization, emergent behavior, and adaptation in complex systems? (loc 5157)</p>
<p><em>Sapir-Whorf – a language for these things can shape the way we think.</em></p>

<p>The most complex entities are not the most ordered or random ones but somewhere in between. (loc 1730)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Gell-Mann proposed that any given entity is composed of a combination of regularity and randomness. (loc 1744)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Many, if not all, complex systems in biology have a fine-grained architecture, in that they consist of large numbers of relatively simple elements that work together in a highly parallel fashion. (loc 3057)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Real-world structures such as coastlines are often called “fractal” as a shorthand, but it is more accurate to call them “fractal-like,” especially if a mathematician is in hearing range. (loc 1876)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It is an appealing idea to identify the complexity of a thing with the amount of information processed in the most plausible method of its creation.” (loc 1779)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Logical depth has very nice theoretical properties that match our intuitions, but it does not give a practical way of measuring the complexity of any natural object of interest, since there is typically no practical way of finding the smallest Turing machine that could have generated a given object, (loc 1788)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>A very important property of scale-free networks is their resilience to the deletion of nodes. (loc 4132)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>scale-free network = power-law degree distribution. (loc 4130)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Scale-free networks have four notable properties: (1) a relatively small number of very high-degree nodes (hubs); (2) nodes with degrees over a very large range of different values (i.e., heterogeneity of degree values); (3) self-similarity; (4) small-world structure. (loc 4118)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>As noted by philosopher and historian of biology Evelyn Fox Keller, “Current assessments of the commonality of power laws are probably overestimates.” Physicist and network scientist Cosma Shalizi had a less polite phrasing of the same sentiments: “Our tendency to hallucinate power laws is a disgrace.” (loc 4285)</p>
<p><em>This is probably because people don&#39;t put in the effort to understand errors transform when doing log-log plots – would be worthwhile generating some data from non-power law relations and seeing whether we would still conclude that there was a power law (to approximate the p-value).</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>fractal structure is one way to generate a power-law distribution; and if you happen to see that some quantity (such as metabolic rate) follows a power-law distribution, then you can hypothesize that there is something about the underlying system that is self-similar or “fractal-like.” (loc 4478)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Although living things occupy a three-dimensional space, their internal physiology and anatomy operate as if they were four-dimensional … Fractal geometry has literally given life an added dimension.” (loc 4508)</p>
<p><em>The fractal nature of objects leads to (literally) extra dimensionality</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But in a complex system such as those I’ve described above, in which simple components act without a central controller or leader, who or what actually perceives the meaning of situations so as to take appropriate actions? This is essentially the question of what constitutes consciousness or self-awareness in living systems. (loc 3109)</p>
<p><em>It is (by definition) hard to develop a simple and intuitive understanding of some complex systems.</em></div></details></p>

<p>The solitary army ant is behaviorally one of the least sophisticated animals imaginable,” and, “If 100 army ants are placed on a flat surface, they will walk around and around in never decreasing circles until they die of exhaustion.” Yet put half a million of them together, and the group as a whole becomes what some have called a “superorganism” with “collective intelligence.” (loc 200)</p>

<p>Geneticists often test their theories about gene function by doing “knockout mutations,” in which they use genetic engineering techniques to prevent the genes in question from being transcribed and see what effect that has on the organism. (loc 2357)</p>

<p>They hypothesize that plants perform a distributed, decentralized computation via their stomata—namely, how to optimally open and close stomata in order to best balance carbon dioxide gain and water loss—and that the computation may be explainable in terms of such particles. (loc 2812)</p>

<p>There are heritable changes in the function of genes that can occur without any modification of the gene’s DNA sequence. Such changes are studied in the growing field of epigenetics. One example is so-called DNA methylation, in which an enzyme in a cell attaches particular molecules to some parts of a DNA sequence, effectively “turning off” those parts. (loc 4672)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>However, recent evidence has indicated that the evolution of these two eyes was not as independent as previously thought. Humans, octopi, flies, and many other species have a common gene called PAX6, which helps direct the development of eyes. In a strange but revealing experiment, the Swiss biologist Walter Gehring took PAX6 genes from mice and inserted them into the genomes of fruit flies. In particular, in different studies, PAX6 was inserted in three different parts of the genome: those that direct the development of legs, wings, and antennae, respectively. The researchers got eerie results: eye-like structures formed on flies’ legs, wings, and antennae. (loc 4773)</p>

<p>He classifies evolutionists into three categories: adaptationists, who believe that natural selection is primary; historicists, who give credit to historical accident for many evolutionary changes; and structuralists, such as Kauffman, who focus on how organized structure comes about even in the absence of natural selection.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Exhalation</em> is a wonderful anthology; the stories and novellas in this collection are delightfully clever, without sacrificing soul. Most of the stories seem to gravitate around the central theme of free will, but there is an exciting variety of ideas and delivery.</p>
<p>As to where Ted Chiang&#39;s work fits into the scifi landscape, I think it&#39;s on par with PKD / Greg Egan in terms of creativity while being markedly more accessible (though readers would certainly benefit from a vague interest in science). However, as is often the case with such creative ideas, it is sometimes difficult for the story to live up to the concepts. This was true on a couple of occasions, but on the balance, this is still a must-read.</p>
<p>Some brief comments on the stories, with no spoilers:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>The Merchant and the Alchemist&#39;s Gate</em> : a &quot;just-so&quot; story about time travel, in which everything is nice and self-consistent.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Exhalation</em> : a gorgeous hard-scifi story about a robot who dissects his own brain, and in so doing, runs into the second law of thermodynamics. This story gave me a much better intuition for entropy!</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>What&#39;s Expected of Us</em> : a brief but incisive exploration into free will.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</em> : could be a novella. An emotive and thoughtful exploration of relationships with digital beings. Reminds me of the film <em>Her</em></li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Dacey&#39;s Patent Automatic Nann</em> y: a brief and fanciful tale of a boy raised by a robot</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</em> : how will we adapt to the Black Mirror style memory review? Very nice contrast with the introduction of written language to tribes. In some senses, it is a more faithful representation of what happened, but it also brings many downsides</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>The Great Silence</em> : short one about how parrots may be sentient but unable to communicate</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Omphalos</em> : an amazing story in which physics is consistent with creationism, with one major caveat...</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal"><em>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom</em> : are our decisions still meaningless even in the many-worlds interpretation of QM?</li>

<p>Eventually, I worked my way around the entire subassembly and replaced every connection it had to the rest of my brain. I was now able to unmount this subassembly from the frame that supported it and pull the whole section outside of what was once the back of my head. (loc 639)</p>

<p>With careful inspection and increasing magnification, I discerned that the tubules ramified into tiny air capillaries, which were interwoven with a dense latticework of wires on which gold leaves were hinged. Under the influence of air escaping from the capillaries, the leaves were held in a variety of positions. These were not switches in the conventional sense, for they did not retain their position without a current of air to support them, but I hypothesized that these were the switches I had sought, the medium in which my memories were recorded. The ripples I saw must have been acts of recall, as an arrangement of leaves was read and sent back to the cognition engine. (loc 660)</p>

For many hours I scrutinized the leaves, until I realized that they themselves were playing the role of capillaries; the leaves formed temporary conduits and valves that existed just long enough to redirect air at other leaves in turn, and then disappeared as a result. This was an engine undergoing continuous transformation, (loc 667)</p>

<p>This is why, at the beginning of this engraving, I said that air is not the source of life. Air can neither be created nor destroyed; the total amount of air in the universe remains constant, and if air were all that we needed to live, we would never die. But in truth the source of life is a difference in air pressure, the flow of air from spaces where it is thick to those where it is thin. (loc 704)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Eventually, all the air in our universe will be evenly distributed, no denser or more rarefied in one spot than in any other, unable to drive a piston, turn a rotor, or flip a leaf of gold foil. It will be the end of pressure, the end of motive power, the end of thought. The universe will have reached perfect equilibrium. (loc 745)</p>

<p>The universe began as an enormous breath being held. Who knows why, but whatever the reason, I am glad that it did, because I owe my existence to that fact. All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy currents generated by the gradual exhalation of our universe. And until this great exhalation is finished, my thoughts live on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our minds are nested hierarchies of pattern-recognition circuits]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating weave of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>Kurzweil presents the pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM), which holds that the fundamental unit of computation in the brain is a group of ~100 neurons in the neocortex that recognises a pattern. The clever part is that these patterns can exist within arbitrarily complex hierarchies, containing &quot;pointers&quot; to other patterns, and feeding input/output to both sub-patterns and parents. It&#39;s a nice theory and seems to explain some empirical findings in neuroscience, though I would defer to a domain expert to comment more on that. Some of his arguments seem quite suspicious: for example, he often justifies his view of how the brain works by implementing the procedure on a computer – according to Kurzweil, if it works on a computer, that is likely how it works in the brain.</p>
<p>The second half of the book is somewhat disorganised, covering the whole gamut of standard topics within the philosophy of mind: computation, consciousness, free will, identity, etc. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a highly accessible introduction containing plenty of references to famous thought experiments and philosophical writings.</p>
<p>The chapter relating to the &quot;Law of Accelerating Returns&quot; is scary. Humans consistently misunderstand exponential growth trends and the result is that the future will come much faster than people realise. Kurzweil convincingly argues that within the next twenty years, we will have reached the singularity and that by the end of this century, cybernetic enhancements will be the norm.</p>
<p>Well worth a read if you are interested in neuroscience, AI, philosophy, or futurism. This book is an excellent complement to sci-fi books dealing with uploading consciousness (e.g. Greg Egan&#39;s <a href="/?books=permutation-city" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Permutation City</a>) – which may not be fiction for much longer!</p>

<p>We can recognize a pattern even if only part of it is perceived (seen, heard, felt) and even if it contains alterations. Our recognition ability is apparently able to detect invariant features of a pattern—characteristics that survive real-world variations.</p>
<p><em>Equivariant ML is a hot field at the moment</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain. Our memories are stored as sequences of patterns. Memories that are not accessed dim over time.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>each of our routine procedures is remembered as an elaborate hierarchy of nested activities.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The face of a loved one, for example, is not stored once but on the order of thousands of times. Some of these repetitions are largely the same image of the face, whereas most show different perspectives of it, different lighting, different expressions, and so on.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The redundancy of patterns is what enables us to recognize objects, people, and ideas even when they have variations and occur in different contexts. The size and size variability parameters also allow the neocortex to encode variation in magnitude against different dimensions (duration in the case of sound).</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Pattern processing</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Kasparov looks at the chessboard and compares the patterns that he sees to all 100,000 board situations that he has mastered, and he does all 100,000 comparisons simultaneously. There is consensus on this point: All of our neurons are processing—considering the patterns—at the same time. That does not mean that they are all firing simultaneously (we would probably fall to the floor if that happened), but while doing their processing are considering the possibility of firing.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It is also reasonable to conclude that the patterns that end up in our dreams represent important matters to us and thereby clues in understanding our unresolved desires and fears.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The most powerful argument for the universality of processing in the neocortex is the pervasive evidence of plasticity (not just learning but interchangeability): In other words, one region is able to do the work of other regions, implying a common algorithm across the entire neocortex.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The basic algorithm of the neocortical pattern recognition modules is equivalent across the neocortex from “low-level” modules, which deal with the most basic sensory patterns, to “high-level” modules, which recognize the most abstract concepts.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Signals go up and down the conceptual hierarchy. A signal going up means, “I’ve detected a pattern.” A signal going down means, “I’m expecting your pattern to occur,” and is essentially a prediction.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Each pattern is itself in a particular order and is not readily reversed. Even if a pattern appears to have multidimensional aspects, it is represented by a one-dimensional sequence of lower-level patterns. A pattern is an ordered sequence of other patterns, so each recognizer is inherently recursive. There can be many levels of hierarchy.</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Learning</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>The capacity of the hippocampus is limited, so its memory is short-term. It will transfer a particular sequence of patterns from its short-term memory to the long-term hierarchical memory of the neocortex by playing this memory sequence to the neocortex over and over again.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The evolution of animal behavior does constitute a learning process, but it is learning by the species, not by the individual, and the fruits of this learning process are encoded in DNA.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Another such change was to have adjacent Markov models “leak” into one another by causing the results of one Markov model to influence models that are “nearby.” Although we did not realize it at the time, the sorts of adjustments we were experimenting with are very similar to the types of modifications that occur in biological cortical structures.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The basic unit of the neocortex is a module of neurons, which I estimate at around a hundred. These are woven together into each neocortical column so that each module is not visibly distinct. The pattern of connections and synaptic strengths within each module is relatively stable. It is the connections and synaptic strengths between modules that represent learning.</p>

<p>Clarity of mind means clarity of passion, too; this is why a great and clear mind loves ardently and sees distinctly what it loves. —Blaise Pascal</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>At the far end of the story of love, a loved one becomes a major part of our neocortex. After decades of being together, a virtual other exists in the neocortex such that we can anticipate every step of what our lover will say and do. Our neocortical patterns are filled with the thoughts and patterns that reflect who they are. When we lose that person, we literally lose part of ourselves. This is not just a metaphor—all of the vast pattern recognizers that are filled with the patterns reflecting the person we love suddenly change their nature. Although they can be considered a precious way to keep that person alive within ourselves, the vast neocortical patterns of a lost loved one turn suddenly from triggers of delight to triggers of mourning.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The neocortex is biology’s greatest creation. In turn, it is the poems about love—and all of our other creations—that represent the greatest inventions of our neocortex.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>My own view, which is perhaps a subschool of panprotopsychism, is that consciousness is an emergent property of a complex physical system. In this view a dog is also conscious but somewhat less than a human.</p>
<p><em>this makes the most sense to me</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In the Western perspective, we start with a physical world that evolves patterns of information. After a few billion years of evolution, the entities in that world have evolved sufficiently to become conscious beings. In the Eastern view, consciousness is the fundamental reality; the physical world only comes into existence through the thoughts of conscious beings. The physical world, in other words, is the thoughts of conscious beings made manifest. These are of course simplifications of complex and diverse philosophies, but they represent the principal polarities in the philosophies of consciousness and its relationship to the physical world.</p>

<p>My core thesis, which I call the law of accelerating returns (LOAR), is that fundamental measures of information technology follow predictable and exponential trajectories, belying the conventional wisdom that “you can’t predict the future.”</p>

<p>According to the law of accelerating returns, by the end of this century we will be able to create computation at the limits of what is possible, based on the laws of physics as applied to computation. We call matter and energy organized in this way “computronium,” which is vastly more powerful pound per pound than the human brain. It will not just be raw computation but will be infused with intelligent algorithms constituting all of human-machine knowledge.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ants are ]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve spent more time than I care to admit watching ants. I am particularly intrigued by the fact that the capability and complexity of ant colonies grow more-than-linearly in the number of ants (i.e the whole is greater than the sum of the parts). A fantastic example of this is the <em>eciton</em> army ant (which I was first introduced to in <a href="/?books=complexity-a-guided-tour" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Complexity: A Guided Tour</a>): if you put 20 army ants on a flat surface they will wander aimlessly until they starve, but when you put 20,000 of them together the result is a delightfully complex information-processing &quot;hivemind&quot; that can significantly alter the surrounding ecology.</p>
<p><em>Secret Lives of Ants</em> is an accessible survey of some of the interesting aspects of ant behaviour. For example, leaf-cutter ants literally farm mushrooms by cutting pieces of leaves to give to the fungus as a fertiliser. <em>Conomyrma bicolor</em> ants lay siege to the nests of honeypot ants by blocking the entrance with rocks. Turtle ants have a guard class of workers who block the entrance to the nest with their hard, flat heads.</p>
<p>There is certainly plenty of anthropomorphisation in this book; ant behaviour is analysed by projecting it onto the human equivalent. While this may come at the cost of some scientific verisimilitude, it makes the book all the more engaging, so perhaps it&#39;s a fair tradeoff.</p>
<p>Jae Choe&#39;s passion for the subject clearly comes through; it makes for a wholesome and informative read that I can unequivocally recommend.</p>

<p>Looking at ant colonies from an industrial economist’s point of view, the nest is territory or factory, the number of worker ants is the labor force, and a colony’s capital is the food the ants have gathered and stored. (loc 353)</p>

<p>Ancient Chinese historical texts tell the story of the revenge of King Gou Jian of Yue and how he vindicated his kingdom’s humiliating defeat at the hands of the state of Wu through a complex plan to build up his armies. Over a period of ten years, he punished the parents of unmarried men and women of marriageable age and forbade all marriages between younger men and older women in order to increase the population of Yue. He also offered many incentives to parents who gave birth to many children. The population grew, King Gou Jian instituted a system of strict military discipline to train his armies, and he eventually drove out the armies of Wu. (loc 1409)</p>

They built tiny robots to perform a waggle dance for bees and successfully sent the bees to a predetermined location. (loc 774)</p>

<p>The leaf-cutter ants of the Latin American rainforests, who haul leaves in their jaws in order to grow mushrooms on them, are considered to have built the first farms on Earth as early as 50 million years ago. (loc 286)</p>

<p>Fire ants, an agricultural pest in the southern United States, have large workers whose only job is to use their millstone-like jaws to grind large seeds. There are also ants that have classes of Goliathlike worker ants that leave the nest only to ruthlessly crush the bodies of enemies during wars with other colonies. Turtle ant colonies have a separate class of workers for guard detail. These ants’ sole duty in life is to protect the nest by blocking the entrance with their unusually wide, flat heads.

<p>The wily honeypot ants, however, have a formidable rival in their neighbors, the Conomyrma bicolor ants. If the Conomyrma bicolor ants find a good source of food first, they immediately send troops to the honeypot ants’ nests and surround the entrances. Once they have laid siege to the honeypot ants’ nest, they carry small rocks in their jaws and drop them into the entrance. While the honeypot ants are preoccupied with this landslide of rocks, other Conomyrma bicolor workers harvest the food. Even the most skilled tacticians meet their match. (loc 1584)</p>

        <updated>2021-12-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is almost a cliche at this point to acknowledge that poker shares many of the same stylised features as real life: it is a game of decision-making under imperfect information, a strange mix of luck and skill. Hollywood has popularised the idea that poker is purely a game of psychology and aggression: whoever can make the most ridiculous bluffs with the best poker face will win the pot. Maybe there&#39;s some truth in this, but the reality is that the &quot;maths&quot; is more important – every action must seek to maximise expected value.</p>
<p>Konnikova takes us on her journey from being an absolute novice at poker to someone competitive at the professional level within just a couple of years. Yes, she has advantages that few others have (a Harvard degree, Columbia PhD in psychology, and mentoring from one of the greatest players of all time), but the book is not meant to be a recipe for how to recreate her success.</p>
<p>Rather, it is a book about applied decision-making, using poker as a case study: the lessons learnt in poker translate into the real world. Among the most important ideas is the difference between skill and luck. People have a tendency to attribute success to skill and failure to bad luck, which gets in the way of learning. Related to this, in poker (as in life) you can make the optimal decisions and still lose if your opponent catches a miracle river. It takes a special self-awareness to be able to avoid getting tilted and to continue making good decisions.</p>
<p><em>The Biggest Bluff</em> is a fun read for anyone interested in poker or finance – it&#39;s no surprise that many great traders are also strong poker players as the skillsets share plenty of overlap. However, while Konnikova succeeds in drawing broadly applicable lessons from poker, I don&#39;t think this book would be as enjoyable for people without a basic understanding of poker (at the very least, the rules of the game, e.g what it means to check, bet, fold).</p>

<p>Cash games are War and Peace. You’re a thousand pages in and still no closer to finding out how the battle resolved itself. You can try to flip ahead, but events will unfold at whatever pace they choose. Tournaments are far more Shakespearean in nature. You’ve barely hit act three and half the cast is already dead. If you want an overview of life at warp speed, tournament poker is the way to go. That’s what I choose. (loc 377)</p>

<p>If you are starting from scratch, can a deep understanding of the human mind win out over the mathematics and statistical wunderkinds of the poker table? In a way, it’s as much a test of life philosophy as anything else. The qualitative side of things versus the measurable. The human versus the algorithmic. (loc 446)</p>

<p>“You have to learn to pay attention to board texture,” Erik tells me. Is it a dry board, one where the cards don’t have much relation to one another—different suits, values spread far apart, making it unlikely that someone has a strong draw? (loc 1104)</p>

<p>Different textures require different strategies. You’re not going to launch the same campaign in the mountains as you will in the plains as you will in an ocean battle.

<p>In this particular case, he holds a key card, the ace of diamonds—a blocker to the nut flush. With two diamonds on the board, he knows that no one else can be drawing to the nuts, because he has the card that would make the best possible hand. Now, if another diamond comes, he can credibly represent having the nuts, even though he has only a single diamond. If I have a blocker, I block you from having the hand I’m representing.

<p>No hands on cards, ever,” Blake warns. People tend to place their hands on their cards in different ways with different parts of their range—one style of motion when strong, another when marginal. (loc 2931)</p>

<p>“A lot of people think that acting robotic at the table is the best way to conceal tells. It’s actually the worst way,” Blake explains. “The more of a cognitive process you have towards concealment, the more of a likelihood that that’s eventually going to be a break and we’re going to see more stuff.” (loc 2937)</p>

<p>“Before each action, stop, think about what you want to do, and execute,” Blake suggests. As long as I always do that, I ensure that I’m thinking through every hand at every part of my range, aces and suited connectors and trash alike. Because I’ve thought before I acted, I act with confidence every time—and I act with a delay every time. (loc 2942)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Comprehensive but far from practical, this is valuable solely as a literature survey for people trying to understand what&#39;s out there in terms of vol forecasting. Many pages are spent detailing the numerous alternatives to classical GARCH, most of which are of dubious practicality (in my opinion). The author makes little effort to compare the practical strengths and weaknesses of the different methods used.</p>
<p>So unless you are specifically interested in the problem of realised volatility forecasting, I would categorically recommend Sinclair&#39;s <a href="/?books=volatility-trading" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Volatility Trading</a> instead.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optimise without an optimiser]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many finance textbooks are 500-page tomes full of arcane mathematics that has very little to do with the real world. Not so for <em>Advanced Portfolio Management</em> . This is a short book clearly focussed on the practitioner, eschewing many of the mathematically elegant but practically dubious techniques like fancy portfolio optimisation in favour of battle-tested heuristics based on the author&#39;s extensive experience. For example, sizing bets in proportion to their alphas alone is often better than MVO due to how MVO accentuates estimation error.</p>
<p>The book does a better job explaining factor risk than some of the classic texts (like G&amp;K), and also provides a nice overview of some of the main factors and proposed explanations. For example, the vol anomaly (high vol stocks underperform) could be explained by the managers&#39; call options driving demand for volatile securities.</p>
<p>I like the experimental approach: for example, the author does an intuitive simulation using ex-post information to demonstrate that MVO is hurt by return misestimation, not covariance misestimation. Also, he shows how simple experiments can help with PnL decomposition. To find out how much PnL is attributable to sizing skill, you can track how the PM&#39;s portfolio performed compared to a hypothetical equal-weighted version.</p>
<p>Unlike other texts, the author devotes a lot of energy to discussing how you should set the value of the constraints (rather than treating them as exogenous inputs) – e.g. what amount of factor vol is acceptable; what leverage should you choose.</p>
<p>Portfolio management books are normally lines upon lines of linear algebra. While there&#39;s a time and place for this, the direct emphasis on practicality was very refreshing. Each chapter starts with the author&#39;s estimate of how often you would need to refer to the content and there are lots of neat heuristics: how to estimate IR from hit rate, how to choose the single-stock weight limit, the standard error of the Sharpe ratio (a classic result from Andrew Lo).</p>
<p>This is a book that any risk-taker should have on their desk!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convertible bond arb, pre Black-Scholes]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Beat the Market</em> outlines the system that Ed Thorp (of blackjack and quant finance fame) used to deliver 20% annual returns for his clients for several decades.</p>
<p>I hope I&#39;m not being overly dismissive when I say that the book is of almost no practical value. The market for warrants and convertible bonds has changed beyond recognition since the book was published in 1967. In particular, the book predates the Black-Scholes model for pricing options, so essentially all of the &quot;warrant-stock diagrams&quot; (now called payoff diagrams) are obsolete.</p>
<p>However, the book has value as a historical curiosity. As an analogy, if you&#39;re an automotive engineer you might be somewhat interested in reading a description of the engineering process of the Model T Ford, even though it has no practical bearing on their current work. That said, I think this characteristic dramatically narrows the appropriate audience for this book – you really have to be a finance “enthusiast” who wants to know how things used to be done.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Religion and politics have always been inseparable]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As good, if not better than the first book (this does not seem to be a common opinion).</p>
<p><em>Dune Messiah</em> is a novel about the limits of destiny, exploring the extent to which we can avoid reaping what we sow. Paul Atreides, 12 years after the events in the first book, appears to be at his apotheosis – heralded as a messianic Emperor. Yet he struggles to control the zeal of his warrior-acolytes and is desperate to avoid the eternal violence revealed in his visions.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by the subtle undercurrents of religious re-interpretation – Paul struggles with the fact that many of his subjects twist religion to &quot;fill a gap&quot; in their lives (vaguely reminiscent of Japanese peasants with Christianity in <em><a href="/?books=silence" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Silence</a></em> ).</p>
<p>The plot is nowhere near as flashy and action-packed as the first novel, but in toning down these elements (though not disposing of them entirely), Herbert has more room to explore the complex interplay between religion and government, as well as the intricacies of statecraft in this Medieval-esque imperial society.</p>
<p>Reading <em>Dune</em> is certainly a prerequisite, but I would encourage the many people who seem to have stopped after <em>Dune</em> to give this a try. It is much shorter and offers a completely different experience to <em>Dune</em> , while significantly developing the characters. Moreover, the ending to <em>Dune Messiah</em> is literally perfect, as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>“Government cannot be religious and self-assertive at the same time. Religious experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress. And you cannot govern without laws. Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience, replace even the religion by which you think to govern. Sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality. Government, on the other hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions and contentions. I see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replaces morality.” (loc 3119)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic space opera in an analogue world, studying the true nature of power]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What an amazing novel. To call <em>Dune</em> science fiction would unnecessarily restrict its importance. It is a genre-defining space opera, drawing on elements of scifi, ecology, theology, and “PPE” – politics, philosophy and economics.</p>
<p><em>Dune</em> is set in the distant future, where it is forbidden to make machines in the image of humans (i.e no AI or humanoid robots). In response to this, humans have evolved special abilities: superior logical reasoning, exceedingly fine control over one&#39;s musculature and mind, or even limited prescience. Society is medieval, with feudal Great Houses operating under the galactic Emperor. This plot decision allows Herbert to focus much more on the politics between houses (similar to <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, or so I&#39;m told) rather than advanced technologies. Economics also plays a key role: the events of the book are precipitated by the planet Arrakis&#39; monopoly on &quot;spice&quot;, the mysterious substance that enables the aforementioned special abilities. Another faction – the Spacing Guild – controls all interstellar space travel, arguably making them more powerful than the Emperor.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that <em>Dune</em> is a particularly complex book – it doesn&#39;t require scifi experience to enjoy (unlike some of PKD&#39;s work) and doesn&#39;t require a deep buy-in to the worldbuilding (unlike Tolkien&#39;s <em>Silmarillion</em> or similar fantasy). However, there are still several layers to enjoy beyond the main plot (compelling as that is): the small distinct mannerisms of different houses – how the antagonistic Harkonnens constantly think about others&#39; pressure points while House Atreides emphasises loyalty, the subtle motifs of revisionist history, the parallels to Lawrence of Arabia and his role in the Arab Revolt during WWI.</p>
<p><em>Dune</em> may look like a long book, but it was highly readable. Herbert embeds a masterful balance between foreshadowing and surprise, making each page a pleasure to read. Definitely worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (March 2021):</strong>**** **I really have to stop re-reading this book!</p>

<p>You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic. —from “Muad’Dib: The Religious Issues” by the Princess (loc 8260)</p>

<p>Many have marked the speed with which Muad‘Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad‘Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson. (loc 1369)</p>

<p>“Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,” she said. “But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan.

<p>Although this doesn&#39;t seem to be the takeaway that Tara intended, I can&#39;t help but feel that stories like hers raise the bar for the rest of us by exemplifying the malleability of our destinies and outlooks. If she was able to overcome years of indoctrination, we have no excuse not to be able to radically improve ourselves.</p>
<p>Tara&#39;s story also highlights the enormous responsibility that parents have. In a way, Tara was lucky that her mother (at least initially) had more &quot;normal&quot; views of education – without this, it&#39;s hard to say what would have happened. One of the saddest lines in the book:</p>
<p>I was intrigued by the concept of historicity in the context of traumatic memories; Tara footnotes the bits that she isn&#39;t sure about and seems quite open about the reliability of her memories (Tyler Westover&#39;s review is a nice counterbalance – see the Goodreads Q&amp;A). An excellent fictional complement to this theme is a short story by Ted Chiang (Exhalation) called <em>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</em> – incidentally, this also explores a father-daughter relationship.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Educated</em> is well-written and engaging, if overly ornate in places (though perhaps this links to the theme of historicity and romanticisation of the past). I think Westover could have done more to draw out the key ideas, but obviously, some of that responsibility falls on the reader.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>the state of Idaho issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth. I remember the day it came in the mail. It felt oddly dispossessing, being handed this first legal proof of my personhood: until that moment, it had never occurred to me that proof was required. (loc 403)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>sometimes wonder if Dad’s fervor had more to do with his own mother than with doctrine. I wonder if he just wished that she had been home, so he wouldn’t have been left for all those long hours with Grandpa’s temper. (loc 494)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>God couldn’t abide faithlessness, Dad said. That’s why the most hateful sinners were those who wouldn’t make up their minds, who used herbs and medication both, who came to Mother on Wednesday and saw their doctor on Friday—or, as Dad put it, “Who worship at the altar of God one day and offer a sacrifice to Satan the next.” (loc 601)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It was as if, when I sang, Dad forgot for a moment that the world was a frightening place, that it would corrupt me, that I should be kept safe, sheltered, at home. He wanted my voice to be heard. (loc 1410)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The disappointment in his features was so childlike, for a moment I wondered how God could deny him this. He, a faithful servant, who suffered willingly just as Noah had willingly suffered to build the ark. But God withheld the flood. (loc 1543)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I wonder now if the day I set out to steal that tax return wasn’t the first time I left home to go to Buck’s Peak. That night I had entered my father’s house as an intruder. It was a shift in mental language, a surrendering of where I was from. My own words confirmed it. (loc 3336)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mill claimed that women have been coaxed, cajoled, shoved and squashed into a series of feminine contortions for so many centuries, that it is now quite impossible to define their natural abilities or aspirations. (loc 4127)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Markets are inefficient enough to justify efficiency-seeking behaviour]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Efficiently Inefficient</em> is a semi-technical survey of buyside finance, explaining how different strategies (e.g long/short equity, quant equity, macro, credit, arbitrage) work, accompanied by interviews with leading practitioners (e.g Ken Griffin, Cliff Asness, John Paulson).</p>
<p>Some of my favourite ideas in the book:</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Efficient Inefficiency: markets are just about inefficient enough to compensate traders for the act of trying to make markets more efficient. As a corollary, we would expect most strategies (credit, equity, macro) to average out to approx the same returns over time.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Backtest-regression equivalence. Predictive regressions are mathematically equivalent to backtests!</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Heisenberg uncertainty in finance: executing trades obeys an uncertainty principle, where you cannot arbitrarily get precise execution time and market impact. e.g if you decide that you need to execute in some short time window, you have to allow for a big market impact.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Expectations hypothesis: in theory, the shape of the futures curve embeds expectations for spot moves. In reality, you can earn some risk premium for being long spot when the curve is in contango.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Soros boom-bust cycles: every bubble requires a real trend, a misconception of the trend, and a feedback loop that links the two</li>
</ul>
<p>But the big problem is that Pedersen hasn&#39;t decided what level of abstraction to pitch the book at. It&#39;s technical and is written in a rather academic way, with a focus on the academic literature more than practical results. The interviews are nowhere near as valuable as those in <em>Market Wizards</em> or <em><a href="/?books=inside-the-house-of-money" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Inside the House of Money</a></em> <em>.</em> As a result, I&#39;m not sure who to recommend this to.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like the title, the book is a little bit forward for my liking (could just be that the author is American), but nevertheless contains valuable insights. I was surprised to see that Carnegie takes a rather pessimistic view of human nature – I was fully expecting a &#39;shiny happy people’ sort of thing. His core thesis is that humans are highly self-centred and all of their behaviour towards you will be determined by how important you can make them feel. In effect, he provides a playbook for thriving in an imperfect world where people only care about themselves, or at least only care about you to the extent that they can further their own aims.</p>
<p>Much of the book is anecdotal in nature; though I took issue with this at first, I suppose that in the limit, anecdote becomes empirical fact (and he really does have mountains of anecdotes). It is readable and entertaining, and I think even sociable people might have something to learn from it.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (Dec 2021)</strong>: I like to think I&#39;ve become much more sociable in the several years since I wrote this review – university probably had some role in that! In hindsight, this book definitely changed the way I approach social situations, hopefully for the better. The words of Emerson have potently stuck with me:</p>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>PRINCIPLE: Don’t criticise, condemn or complain.</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument – and that is to avoid it</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other people they are wrong?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Never begin by announcing ‘I am going to prove so-and-so to you.’ That’s bad. That’s tantamount to saying: ‘I’m smarter than you are.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Inside the House of Money</em> is a fantastic collection of interviews with hedge fund managers, similar to <em>Market Wizards</em> , but with a specific focus on global macro. Macro is fascinating to me primarily because of its broad mandate: as a macro fund manager (though probably not so for new analysts) you can go from making relative value trades on the Japanese yield curve to punting on stocks Kuwaiti stocks – like the trader who bought shares in glass manufacturers after an earthquake in 1999.</p>
<p>In addition to the oft-repeated trading wisdom (be emotionally disciplined, cut your losses, leverage your winners), <em>Inside the House of Money</em> also contains points that are a bit more subtle. If I could only take one lesson from this book, it would be this: **be very careful shorting gamma **– in other words, look for convex bets that pay you a lot if you are right but you only lose a little if you are wrong and always remember that extreme price moves can easily be followed by more extreme price moves.</p>

<p>Global macro only means that you start at the top and work your way down. A simple way to start is to differentiate between good countries and bad countries. We classify twin surplus countries as good and twin deficit countries as bad. When we find good countries, we then dig in and ask, “What can we do in this country? Why are things changing for the better?” When we find bad countries we ask, “Which sectors of this country are bad? How is that going to express itself? Is the currency going to go down? Is the stock market going to go down?”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>in general, it’s good to step away from the story and take it back to the numbers. Trading off a story is too amorphous. We need to quantify things and understand why things are cheap or expensive by using some hard measure of what cheap or expensive means. Then there has to be a combination of story and value. A story is still required because a story will appeal to other people and appeal is what drives markets. If there’s no story and something’s cheap, it might just stay cheap forever. But if there’s a story involved, make sure that you first look at the numbers before you get involved to be sure there is some quantitative backing to the idea.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Real arbitrage, in the old sense of the word, meant that there was no risk at all. Arbitrage today means a huge amount of risk is required to take advantage of small perceived mispricings.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When my colleagues talk about how bad the market feels, I say, “I don’t care how it feels. We’re not here to take the pulse of the market. We’re here to look at how much carry we can get for this position relative to expectations about where we think central banks are going.” As such, we try to take the other side of market distress when people are blowing out of positions because we don’t have to worry as much about the mark-to-market of the position.</p>
<p><em>It is behaviour we’re interested in, not feelings (though feelings may drive behaviour). c.f.</em> <em><a href="/?books=the-front-office" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Front Office</a></em> <em>.</em></p>

<p>one of my colleagues was into charting the bond market and when I first saw his charts, they reminded me of the stimulus and response graphs we got from our conditioning experiments on rats and pigeons. From a trading perspective, it’s very simple. There’s stimulus, response, reward, and punishment. To every trading action, there will always be some kind of initial response which will have decreasing marginal responses. Thus one has to be increasingly reinforced to elicit the same response. The longer an individual has been rewarded for a given response, the longer it will take to extinguish the response when the reward is no longer forthcoming. Then we introduce the concept of punishment. With punishment, conditioned responses get extinguished more quickly. This provides a framework to analyze markets but it doesn’t necessarily predict where things are going.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Global macro is about trying to find imbalances within or between the major asset classes, which are equities, commodities, fixed income, and foreign exchange. Macro is at the top of the hill looking down, trying to find which of those four big chess pieces is about to move.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To me, foreign exchange is not a true macro strategy. It’s the tail of the distribution. There is only one true macro trade and that’s the price of money. Everything else is a function of the price of money.</p>

<p>When people say things like, “This has never traded above X” or “This has never happened before” or “It’s never moved more than three standard deviations,” it often does just that.</p>

<p>What signals a great macro trade? I’m looking for signs of a gestalt shift in markets, where all of a sudden, the market’s view on something instantly changes. The Asia crisis was a great example, where overnight it went from the Asian miracle to a house built on sand. Both were wrong, by the way.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When you own an option that becomes very cheap or worthless, you don’t sell it. You keep it in the back of a drawer and forget about it until the expiry date comes around, at which point you open the drawer and see if it’s worth anything.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>historically, long periods of stability are often followed by extreme dislocations as leveraged positions built up during the “safe” environment cause significant bottlenecks when there is a sudden shift in the investment climate and a rush for the exit.</p>

<p>one correlation the brilliant minds of LTCM neglected to consider was the correlation coefficient of positions that were linked for no other reason than the fact that they were in LTCM’s portfolio. In other words, their models didn’t provide for the LTCM liquidity premium.</p>

<p>you should never be short gamma. I’ve become very anti any kind of short gamma trade. That includes carry trades, which in my mind are essentially synthetic short gamma trades. I’m a great believer that portfolios in the macro space should always be long gamma, not short. Never, ever be short gamma.</p>

<p>I don’t do relative value trades for two reasons: (1) Negative gamma is implicit in relative value trading because it works on regression to the mean; and (2) it is very labor intensive, which drives me nuts.</p>

<p>The hedge funds that blow up are always the one’s who misestimate how much liquidity is in the marketplace. It’s always the same thing, it’s always liquidity.</p>

<p>if every single position in my book hit its stop and all the options expired worthless tomorrow, how much would I lose, and am I comfortable with that number? If I’m not comfortable with that number, then I must look at my risk again.</p>

<p>The best experience a young trader can have is to know what it’s really like to have on the wrong position and not be able to get out. There is nothing you can read to learn that.</p>

<p>Price moves are mainly driven by government data that reflects the underlying economy. As a result, 75 percent of price movement happens only 10 to 15 percent of the time. The rest is nothing but noise within a range. As a macro trader, I am trying to capture those occasional moves, and the best way I know to do that is by owning options, being long gamma and vega. The really cool thing about an option-based strategy like this is that my leverage becomes a function of my correct macro analysis. If I’m right in my macro call, I’m going to lever into it and if I am wrong, I am going to reduce leverage.</p>

<p>Once we realize that imperfect understanding is the human condition, there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes. —George Soros</p>

<p>I came to realize that I was absolutely unemotional about numbers. Losses did not have an effect on me because I viewed them as purely probability-driven, which meant sometimes you came up with a loss. Bad days, bad weeks, bad months never impacted the way I approached markets the next day.</p>
<p><em>Ideal, but maybe unrealistic.</em></p>

<p>Taking off a trade that is winning for the wrong reasons requires a lot of discipline. When that happens, you should get out of the position straightaway.</p>

<p>Another question was, “What makes a great trader?” which is actually not the right question. The right question is, “How does one embody the qualities to become a great trader?” The most important quality of a trader is discipline. That is a sine qua non of trading; one must have discipline. It is even more important than idea generation. The key over time is to have the discipline to capitalize on your successes and minimize your mistakes because, ultimately, the game is about preservation of capital.</p>

<p>When things go badly for reasons you don’t understand or for reasons that you understand but that aren’t the reasons that you initially got into the trade, you really should cut the trade as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Another one of the key lessons from Paul was intellectual flexibility. However strongly you believe in something and however coherent the case is, you need to be (1) willing to accept that you might be wrong, and (2) able to take the position off even though you may not be wrong in a medium-term sense.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Many traders I’ve met over the years approach the market as if they’re smarter than other people until somebody or something proves them wrong. I have found this approach eventually leads to disaster when the market proves them wrong.</p>

<p>Don’t be a dick for a tick! I could have locked in a 97 basis point risk-free profit but instead I held out for 100 basis points. Nowadays, we are more than happy to pay to get trades done. We try to work with our sales coverage and the investment banks to get our transactions filled smoothly. We know they have to make a living so we do not like to put them in competition.</p>

<p>The empirical tendency of forward exchange rates is to overestimate changes in spot exchange rates. According to the theory of uncovered interest arbitrage, forward exchange rates are unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates, implying that a forward contract’s expected return equals 0 percent. It is an empirical fact, however, that during the modern floating rate era, the forward exchange rates of the major currencies have predicted larger subsequent changes in the spot rates than have occurred.</p>

<p>People who trade the curve delude themselves into thinking they’re in a hedged position. The yield curve is 90 percent explained by the direction of interest rates. If you have on a curve steepener, you basically think the bonds are going to rally, and if you have on a curve flattener, you think the market is going to sell off.</p>

<p>There is nothing mystic about me—I’m not into astrology and I don’t ask people for their signs—but I once read this empirical study on the very statistically significant correlation between full moons and trend reversals. I trust the guy who did this study and I find it quite interesting. And it makes sense that the gravitational force of the moon can have an effect on human behavior.</p>

<p>For every trade, we also try to identify what I call nonprice indicators that we feel should be going a certain way as the trade progresses. For example, when we short equity markets, we track volatility indicators and various sentiment indicators that tell us if people are getting more optimistic or pessimistic.</p>

<p>For example, when Turkey had a massive earthquake in 1999, we bought shares of glass manufacturers because we knew everybody was going to have to replace their windows. It was a no-brainer. Turkish stocks were going down across the board but we bought all the shares of glass manufacturers we could.</p>

<p>Money is always moving somewhere, whether it’s from oil to currencies to metals or to stocks. I follow it. The only time when global money doesn’t flow is when it’s afraid, like during 1998 or after 9/11, and then it heads to Switzerland. Markets are based on two emotions: fear and greed. The greed part is nice when you’re a part of it and are invested, but when fear takes over, it’s an unbelievable thing. Money starts running for cover and stops thinking about return. It just wants to save its principal.</p>

<p>classic one was the Brazilian real devaluation in 1999. My matrix told me that I should be selling soybeans as a result of the devaluation. Brazilian farmers got paid in dollars as most commodities are priced in dollars, so they made an astronomical amount of money in their local currency after the devaluation. They started selling as many soybeans as they could and planted fence post to fence post—supply rocketed and prices collapsed.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The market oscillates between greed and fear]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This book is awful. I can hardly believe I&#39;m writing this, because Marks&#39; other book,** <em><a href="/?books=the-most-important-thing" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Most Important Thing</a></em> **, is categorically excellent. It truly feels like the publisher asked him to excrete a book against his will, so he decided to copy-paste stuff from his Oaktree letters. The letters themselves are great, but this semi-commentary format is weird.</p>
<p>The core idea in the book is that markets undergo cycles, largely driven by reflexive investor psychology. In good times, people think things will only get better and are willing to invest at high prices, or loan money at very low rates. Inevitably this leads to very poor returns when reality catches up. After the crash, people think that good times will never return, creating amazing bargains for those willing to be contrarian.</p>
<p>This is an important idea (and the only reason why I haven&#39;t given this book 1 star). Yet it is essentially repeated in every chapter of the book. My suggestion:</p>
<ol>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Read** <em><a href="/?books=the-most-important-thing" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Most Important Thing</a></em> ** – there is a chapter on cycles that renders this book unnecessary.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Watch Ray Dalio&#39;s 31min youtube video <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0">How The Economic Machine Works</a></em> ** (it&#39;s only 15min on 2x speed!)</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Forget this book exists.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A very difficult read, but it is important to be reminded about the depths of human cruelty so we never return there. Comic strips are the perfect format for a story like this: pure text would inhibit the communication of the gruesome realities.</p>
<p><em>Maus</em> is harrowing but full of heart – the book is told from the perspective of Art himself as he tries to pull the story out of his father; interleaved with the horrors of the Holocaust, we get to see the humorous turbulence of the father-son relationship.</p>
<p>If you liked <em>Persepolis</em> , you will enjoy this (and vice versa).</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Master manipulator, or victim of a witch hunt?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an exceptional biography – Gupta leads us through his journey from being an orphan in Calcutta, to Harvard Business School, to the helm of McKinsey and numerous philanthropic efforts, to his disgrace in the famed Galleon insider trading case.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s true. You can&#39;t achieve such success without also having a gift for crafting narratives – it&#39;s worth noting that all of Gupta&#39;s subsequent appeals have been denied – but his side of the story casts more than reasonable doubt on the prosecution&#39;s case. For example, the prosecution couldn&#39;t prove that Gupta made any money from the alleged nonpublic tips (which I always thought was a necessary condition for something to be insider trading, but apparently not). The problem stems from the fact that the prosecution and the judges <em>wanted</em> Gupta to be guilty – post 2008, there was a sentiment that &quot;someone&quot; needed to be blamed. The government&#39;s lawyers seized on Gupta as an opportunity to advance their careers, rather than in the interest of &quot;justice&quot; (though can they be blamed for behaving as incentivised?)</p>
<p>Even setting all the courtroom drama aside – in fact, even if you thought Gupta was guilty – it&#39;s a wonderful read. We shouldn&#39;t forget that prior to the insider trading case, Gupta was in the top echelon of the business world, sitting on the boards of companies like Goldman Sachs and in regular contact with former presidents and people like Bill Gates, so there is clearly a lot to be learnt from his success. But what I appreciated most was the introspective nature of the book: the internal debates about whether things could have been done differently, the verses of poetry from Rabindranath Tagore and the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> , the parallels to tough choices his father made as a freedom fighter under British rule.</p>
<p>Read this if you&#39;re on the lookout for a different kind of business biography – <em>Mind Without Fear</em> certainly ranks among the best of them.</p>

<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">If someone else wants to do it, let him 2. If you have ten problems, ignore them – nine will go away 3. Being there is 90% of the game 4. You can’t push a noodle; find the right angle and pull 5. The softer you blow your own trumpet, the louder it will sound 6. There is no such thing as too much work or too little time 7. Listening takes a lot less energy 8. When in doubt, invite them home.</li>

<p>Gates took a trip to India, and was mobbed by reporters asking him why I was still on his board. I couldn’t sit by and watch while my troubles detracted from the important mission of the foundation, so I insisted that he accept my resignation, which he reluctantly did. (loc 677)</p>

<p>That was the real story behind many of the events referenced in the charges.

<p>I found that even I couldn’t follow the narrative—and I had lived it. I had a sense, that day, of being almost outside of myself, observing the proceedings in the courtroom from a great distance.

<p>I wondered how it must appear to the jurors. It certainly bore little resemblance to the courtrooms portrayed in the movies, with lawyers making eloquent speeches and rapid-firing questions at witnesses. I imagined it was like trying to watch a movie being made by two competing directors at the same time. The actors would begin a scene, but every two minutes one or other of the directors would yell “Cut!” and everyone would go off into a huddle on the side. (loc 3491)</p>

<p>America is clearly a land of opportunity, a land where immigrants can succeed, meritocracy holds, and hard work pays off. It had afforded me an education and a career, and given me and my family a standard of living we could never have achieved at home. For all of this, I felt very much in America’s debt. Yet the same country that had given me so much had taken away my freedom as punishment for a crime I did not commit. And now I was witnessing the incarceration crisis first-hand. How could this coexist with the America I had grown to love and respect? Before long, my consultant’s mind was hard at work devising a new and better criminal justice system on the back of cafeteria napkins. (loc 4271)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m currently working my way through the equity investing classics. <em>One Up On Wall Street</em> is among the best I&#39;ve read. I decided to read the book after watching a few talks by Peter Lynch and have not been disappointed – it is both informative and hilarious.</p>
<p>The central theme is that if you want to be successful in stocks, you have to find your edge. This is a point that many other classics skip over, instead jumping straight into the analytical techniques. Lynch continually emphasises the importance of thinking for yourself, preferring stocks that have very little analyst coverage from Wall Street or economists:</p>
<p>It&#39;s a very refreshing framework for thinking about stocks, and the book is packed with tips and things to look for when you&#39;re examining a company.</p>
<p>In summary, there&#39;s a huge amount to be learnt from Peter Lynch and his writing style makes this a very painless process.</p>

<p>When Hanes interviewed hundreds of women leaving the test supermarkets and asked them if they’d just bought panty hose, a high percentage answered yes. Yet most of them couldn’t recall the name of the brand. Hanes was ecstatic. If a product becomes a best-seller without brand-name recognition, imagine how it will sell once the brand is publicized.</p>

<p>People seem more comfortable investing in something about which they are entirely ignorant. There seems to be an unwritten rule on Wall Street: If you don’t understand it, then put your life savings into it.</p>
<p><em>Too real in the crypto space!</em></p>

<p>There’s an unwritten rule on Wall Street: “You’ll never lose your job losing your client’s money in IBM.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The true contrarian is not the investor who takes the opposite side of a popular hot issue (i.e., shorting a stock that everyone else is buying). The true contrarian waits for things to cool down and buys stocks that nobody cares about, and especially those that make Wall Street yawn.</p>

<p>If forty Wall Street analysts are giving the stock their highest recommendation, 60 percent of the shares are held by institutions, and three national magazines have fawned over the CEO, then it’s definitely time to think about selling.</p>

<p>“The bearish argument always sounds more intelligent.” You can find good reasons to scuttle your equities in every morning paper and on every broadcast of the nightly news.</p>
<p><em>This quote has really stuck with me. The market goes up on average, so we should probably be bullish on average.</em></p>

<p>I’d say that the 50,000 stockpickers are usually right, but only for the last 20 percent of a typical stock move. It’s that last 20 percent that Wall Street studies for, clamors for, and then lines up for—all the while with a sharp eye on the exits. The idea is to make a quick gain and then stampede out the door.</p>

<p>A fast-growing company doesn’t necessarily have to belong to a fast-growing industry.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>while the smaller fast growers risk extinction, the larger fast growers risk a rapid devaluation when they begin to falter. Once a fast grower gets too big, it faces the same dilemma as Gulliver in Lilliput. There’s simply no place for it to stretch out.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>But for as long as they can keep it up, fast growers are the big winners in the stock market. I look for the ones that have good balance sheets and are making substantial profits. The trick is figuring out when they’ll stop growing, and how much to pay for the growth.</p>

<p>for every single product in a hot industry, there are a thousand MIT graduates trying to figure out how to make it cheaper in Taiwan. As soon as a computer company designs the best word-processor in the world, ten other competitors are spending $100 million to design a better one, and it will be on the market in eight months.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>One more thing about growth rate: all else being equal, a 20-percent grower selling at 20 times earnings (a p/e of 20) is a much better buy than a 10-percent grower selling at 10 times earnings (a p/e of 10).</p>

<p>Because the major cyclicals are large and well-known companies, they are naturally lumped together with the trusty stalwarts. Since Ford is a blue chip, one might assume that it will behave the same as Bristol-Myers, another blue chip (see charts). But this is far from the truth. Ford’s stock fluctuates wildly as the company alternately loses billions of dollars in recessions and makes billions of dollars in prosperous stretches.</p>

<p>It’s the kind of debt, as much as the actual amount, that separates the winners from the losers in a crisis. There’s bank debt and there’s funded debt. Bank debt (the worst kind, and the kind that GCA had) is due on demand.</p>

<p>professional short sellers, who profit on stocks that go down in price, usually take their positions nearer to the bottom than to the top. The short sellers like to wait until a company is so obviously foundering that bankruptcy is a certainty. It doesn’t bother them to get involved at $8 or $6 a share instead of at $60, because if the stock goes to zilch, they’ll make exactly the same profit in either instance.</p>
<p><em>The mechanics of short selling often lead to interesting implications (like the one above). Another is that for short positions, your position grows as it moves against you, leading to a kind of short gamma profile.</em></p>

<p>I had identical reservations about the founder and principal shareholder in Televideo, whom I’d met at a group luncheon in Boston. Already he owned $100 million worth of shares in a company with a high p/e ratio, and in the very competitive computer peripherals industry. I thought to myself: If I make money in Televideo, this guy is going to be worth $200 million. That didn’t seem realistic, either. I declined to invest, and that stock went from $40½ in 1983 to $1 in 1987.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Philosophical reading about the persecution of Christians in Japan]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Silence</em> is a deeply thoughtful piece of historical fiction, set in 17th century Japan, portraying the suffering of Japanese Christians in graphic detail.</p>
<p>However, it is not a &quot;Christian book”, even though it was written by a devout Catholic. In fact, the novel feels more like a Socratic dialogue about Christianity in Japan, told through the voice of the calm, logical, yet unbelievably cruel Japanese rulers.</p>
<p>I loved the motif of Japanese culture as a swamp – something that absorbs foreign teaching (religious or otherwise) but ultimately reinterprets it. You can feel the growing desperation of the Brothers as they realise that all the suffering might be going to waste as their message gets lost in cultural translation, and their internal struggles as they wrestle with apostatising (publicly renouncing their faith) to save others from suffering.</p>
<p><em>Silence</em> is well worth the read, whether from a secular or religious perspective. If you are short on time, the introduction is a brilliant summary of Endo&#39;s philosophy and makes for a fantastic companion to either the main text or the film.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>[Endo’s prologue]</p>
<p>For a long time I was attracted to a meaningless nihilism and when I finally came to realize the fearfulness of such a void I was struck once again with the grandeur of the Catholic Faith. This problem of the reconciliation of my Catholicism with my Japanese blood … has taught me one thing: that is, that the Japanese must absorb Christianity without the support of a Christian tradition or history or legacy or sensibility. Even this attempt is the occasion of much resistance and anguish and pain, still it is impossible to counter by closing one’s eyes to the difficulties. No doubt this is the peculiar cross that God has given to the Japanese. (loc 163)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The reason our religion has penetrated this territory like water flowing into dry earth is that it has given to this group of people a human warmth they never previously knew. (loc 634)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The wisdom of peasants shows itself in their ability to pretend that they are fools. (loc 881)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ostensible Machiavellian playbook, but better seen as an applied history course.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fully aware of the stereotype of a &quot;finance guy reading the <em>Art of War</em> &quot;, I nevertheless have to say that the <em>48 Laws of Power</em> is an intellectual tour de force and a valuable read. This is a book I <em>wish</em> I had read years ago – and re-read several times since.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a darker and more comprehensive version of <a href="/?books=how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>, with extra emphasis on control and manipulation, but free of Carnegie&#39;s optimism. Greene drops bangers like &quot;Law 7: get others to do the work for you but always take the credit&quot; and &quot;Law 10: avoid the unhappy and unlucky&quot;, making no attempt to soften or apologise for the message.</p>
<p>But far from being a banal Machiavellian how-to guide, the <em>48 Laws</em> can be seen as a delightful &quot;applied history&quot; course. Each chapter draws on several historical case studies, illustrating both observances and transgressions of the law in a structured and accessible manner. Granted, the fact that people like Cesare Borgia and Henry Kissinger are cited as role models may be a red flag to some, but it&#39;s important and interesting to learn about their methods even if you disagree with their actions and objectives.</p>
<p>Power itself is neither good nor bad. As the author explains, you can use the <em>48 Laws</em> as an offensive guide to manipulate people and gain power, or as a defensive playbook to identify situations in which your good nature is being exploited by the less scrupulous. Greene shares deep wisdom about the way people tick and provides excellent advice on how to carry yourself in a diverse range of situations. Corporate things like &quot;don&#39;t embarrass your boss&quot;; practical social things like &quot;have a sharp wit but never criticise taste/appearance&quot;; general prescriptions like &quot;turn people down respectfully, even if you think their offer is ridiculous&quot;.</p>
<p>The <em>48 Laws</em> shouldn&#39;t be read in one go. Chip away at it, mull over the content, and reflect on its relevance to your life. Once you are aware of the Laws, you start to see them at play everywhere.</p>

<p>An emotional response to a situation is the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feelings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control. (loc 226)</p>

But emperors were fallible and the kingdom suffered greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the court chronicles was the only way to warn them.

<p>In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one outstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning.

<p>In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to visit, and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn—her own baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu’s plan. Shortly thereafter, the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of government to Wu Chao, who was from then on known as Empress Wu. (loc 2603)</p>

<p>There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents problems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long time: the drawn-out, years-long kind of time that must be managed with patience and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defensive—this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity. Next there is forced time: the short-term time that we can manipulate as an offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our opponents. Finally there is end time, when a plan must be executed with speed and force. We have waited, found the moment, and must not hesitate. (loc 6651)</p>

<p>Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they do not figure out what you are up to.

Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pressure, making them feel that everything is happening at once. (loc 6703)</p>

<p>Violent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that Athens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more satisfying, and less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish: Every year they would gather in the marketplace and write on a piece of earthenware, an ostrakon, the name of an individual they wanted to see banished from the city for ten years. If a particular name appeared on six thousand ballots, that person would instantly be exiled. If no one received six thousand votes, the person with the most ostraka recording his name would suffer the ten-year “ostracism.” (loc 8151)</p>

He played the oldest card in the book—threatening with one hand while holding out the olive branch with the other—and Dante fell for it.

For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the game of power: One resolute person, one disobedient spirit, can turn a flock of sheep into a den of lions. So he isolated the troublemaker. Without the backbone of the city to keep them together, the sheep quickly scattered. (loc 8257)</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Think second-order, understand value relative to price, and know where you are in the cycle]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So full of investment wisdom – I <em>wish</em> I had read this book in March 2020. While I sold most of my portfolio in February 2020, missing the majority of the COVID selloff, I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I was slow on the rebound. <em>The Most Important Thing</em> is a short read and is split into 20 chapters, each detailing a different lesson. Marks manages to share his considerable wisdom with humility and without cliche. The only possible criticism is that there is a huge amount of focus on the 2004-2009 time period, but these are precisely the parts that I wish I had read sooner.</p>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways is the importance of &quot;second-level thinking&quot;. The first level is often trivially easy (i.e. COVID is bad for the markets) and consequently does not offer sustainable opportunity unless you are one of the few people in the world who is good at market timing and very quick to react. Rather, you need to think of second-order effects, have a keen sense of value relative to price, and know where you are in the cycle. <em>The Most Important Thing</em> is not a practical guide to investment, but it is a wonderful book on how to think about markets.</p>

<p>Secondlevel thinking is deep, complex and convoluted. The secondlevel thinker takes a great many things into account: • What is the range of likely future outcomes? • Which outcome do I think will occur? • What’s the probability I’m right? • What does the consensus think? • How does my expectation differ from the consensus? • How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine? • Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish? • What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I’m right?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the prevalence of first-level thinkers increases the returns available to secondlevel thinkers. To consistently achieve superior investment returns, you must be one of them.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>You must do things not just because they’re the opposite of what the crowd is doing, but because you know why the crowd is wrong. Only then will you be able to hold firmly to your views and perhaps buy more as your positions take on the appearance of mistakes and as losses accrue rather than gains.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I agree that because investors work hard to evaluate every new piece of information, asset prices immediately reflect the consensus view of the information’s significance. I do not, however, believe the consensus view is necessarily correct.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>we should assume that efficiency will impede our achievement unless we have good reason to believe it won’t in the present case. Respect for efficiency says that before we embark on a course of action, we should ask some questions: have mistakes and mispricings been driven out through investors’ concerted efforts, or do they still exist, and why?</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Risk</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Return alone—and especially return over short periods of time—says very little about the quality of investment decisions. Return has to be evaluated relative to the amount of risk taken to achieve it. And yet, risk cannot be measured. Certainly it cannot be gauged on the basis of what “everybody” says at a moment in time. Risk can be judged only by sophisticated, experienced secondlevel thinkers.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The truth is, risk tolerance is antithetical to successful investing. When people aren’t afraid of risk, they’ll accept risk without being compensated for doing so … and risk compensation will disappear.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Risk—the possibility of loss— is not observable. What is observable is loss, and loss generally happens only when risk collides with negative events.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Because ensuring the ability to survive under adverse circumstances is incompatible with maximizing returns in the good times, investors must choose between the two.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I don’t think many investment managers’ careers end because they fail to hit home runs. Rather, they end up out of the game because they strike out too often—not because they don’t have enough winners, but because they have too many losers. And yet, lots of managers keep swinging for the fences.</p>
<p><em>If you can be a 60th percentile investor over many years, you will end up as a 90+ percentile investor over all.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Defensive investing sounds very erudite, but I can simplify it: Invest scared! Worry about the possibility of loss. Worry that there’s something you don’t know. Worry that you can make high-quality decisions but still be hit by bad luck or surprise events. Investing scared will prevent hubris; will keep your guard up and your mental adrenaline flowing; will make you insist on adequate margin of safety; and will increase the chances that your portfolio is prepared for things going wrong. And if nothing does go wrong, surely the winners will take care of themselves.</p>
<p><em>Obviously this is heavily influenced by the fact that Marks is a credit investor. His perspectives on risk contain deep wisdom, but need to be modulated accordingly before application in general trading.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Over a full career, most investors’ results will be determined more by how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness of their winners. Skillful risk control is the mark of the superior investor.</p>

<p>Cycles are self-correcting, and their reversal is not necessarily dependent on exogenous events. They reverse (rather than going on forever) because trends create the reasons for their own reversal. Thus, I like to say success carries within itself the seeds of failure, and failure the seeds of success.</p>

<p>Many of the psychological or emotional sources of error were discussed in previous chapters: greed and fear; willingness to suspend disbelief and skepticism; ego and envy; the drive to pursue high returns through risk bearing; and the tendency to overrate one’s foreknowledge. These things contribute to booms and busts, in which most investors join together to do exactly the wrong thing.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>among the pitfalls attributable to psychology is investors’ occasional willingness to accept the novel rationales that underlie bubbles and crashes, usually out of a belief that “it’s different this time.”</p>

<p>Especially in good times, far too many people can be overheard saying, “Riskier investments provide higher returns. If you want to make more money, the answer is to take more risk.” But riskier investments absolutely cannot be counted on to deliver higher returns. Why not? It’s simple: if riskier investments reliably produced higher returns, they wouldn’t be riskier! The correct formulation is that in order to attract capital, riskier investments have to offer the prospect of higher returns, or higher promised returns, or higher expected returns. But there’s absolutely nothing to say those higher prospective returns have to materialize.</p>

<p>There’s no bright-line distinction between value and growth; both require us to deal with the future. Value investors think about the company’s potential for growth, and the “growth at a reasonable price” school pays explicit homage to value. It’s all a matter of degree. However, I think it can fairly be said that growth investing is about the future, whereas value investing emphasizes current-day considerations but can’t escape dealing with the future.</p>

<p>It was readily apparent immediately after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers that … a spiral was under way, and no one could see how or when it might end. That was really the problem: no scenario was too negative to be credible, and any scenario incorporating an element of optimism was dismissed as Pollyannaish. There was an element of truth in this, of course: nothing was impossible. But in dealing with the future, we must think about two things: (a) what might happen and (b) the probability that it will happen.</p>

<p>by the time the knife has stopped falling, the dust has settled and the uncertainty has been resolved, there’ll be no great bargains left. When buying something has become comfortable again, its price will no longer be so low that it’s a great bargain. Thus, a hugely profitable investment that doesn’t begin with discomfort is usually an oxymoron.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The key during a crisis is to be (a) insulated from the forces that require selling and (b) positioned to be a buyer instead. To satisfy those criteria, an investor needs the following things: staunch reliance on value, little or no use of leverage, long-term capital and a strong stomach. Patient opportunism, buttressed by a contrarian attitude and a strong balance sheet, can yield amazing profits during meltdowns.</p>

<p>it’s important to bear in mind that in addition to times when the errors are of commission (e.g., buying) and times when they are of omission (failing to buy), there are times when there’s no glaring error. When investor psychology is at equilibrium and fear and greed are balanced, asset prices are likely to be fair relative to value. In that case there may be no compelling action, and it’s important to know that, too. When there’s nothing particularly clever to do, the potential pitfall lies in insisting on being clever.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Data visualisation is a surprisingly new field – line charts were only invented in the late 18th century. With the exponential growth in the amount of data being produced, data viz is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Tufte&#39;s book is widely seen as the canonical text in the field. The book itself is gorgeously typeset and contains stunning reproductions of both good and bad examples of charts. He introduces useful concepts such as the data-ink ratio: the ratio of the ink used to convey actual data vs ink for the display overall (e.g. things like gridlines), which we should maximise.</p>
<p>It sounds sensible, but at the risk of sounding silly, I simply disagree with some of his suggestions? The chapter on data-ink maximisation is a circus, full of bizarre suggestions to maximise the data:ink ratio by cutting off various useful parts of the graph.</p>
<p>Further, most of Tufte&#39;s advice is aimed at graphics for use in print — especially academic writing — rather than for business use-cases like corporate powerpoints. In the latter scenario, I think much of his advice inverts. For example, let&#39;s say you wanted to convey the populations of the 7 continents. Tufte would suggest that you use a table of numbers – not a chart – to convey this information (Tufte is also morally opposed to pie charts). Yet with a non-technical audience, I think simple charts often tell the story much better even if they are not an efficient use of ink.</p>

        <updated>2021-12-13T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <em>Market Wizards</em> series has taught me so much about trading – finance is a very opaque industry so any insight into the mindset and methodology of successful practitioners is immensely valuable.</p>
<p>This edition focuses on small-time (”retail”) traders who trade their personal accounts, rather than the hedge fund titans from previous editions (e.g <a href="/?books=the-new-market-wizards" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The New Market Wizards</a>). The message isn&#39;t that &quot;anyone can trade&quot; – the traders are clearly above average in many respects (e.g intelligence and discipline) and have put in years of their lives into mastering their craft. Rather, the point is that success in trading is not determined by pedigree, though in reality it’s easier to get a trading seat in the first place if you’ve got the right credentials.</p>
<p>Several of the stock traders in the book are poster children of Peter Lynch&#39;s <a href="/?books=one-up-on-wall-street" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">One Up On Wall Street</a> – they know that Wall Street traders have edge in some areas, so they instead keep their ears to the ground looking for their own edge. For example, Jeffrey Neumann made a fantastic trade on CBD drinks just by talking to the managers and customers of convenience stores; Chris Camilio succesfully traded Netflix stock by tracking social media chatter after the launch of <em>Stranger Things.</em></p>
<p>Much of the wisdom here has already been mentioned in the previous books (for example, the importance of discipline and risk management). I think that goes to show that these traits are necessary conditions for success. But they are certainly not sufficient conditions! My main takeaway from this edition is that there is no formula for success in trading – you have to figure out your own approach. Exciting and daunting!</p>

<p>Whenever I place a trade, I think, “A year from now when I look back at the chart, will I be able to see in the chart the day and the price at which I took a position?” (loc 385)</p>

<p>What I have found is that when you have a big move down, the first rally never holds. If there is ever a case where I want to sell into strength, it would be the first rally after a straight-line drop. Often the rally will last for only two days after the reversal day. (loc 624)</p>

<p>The only thing I have found that still works are patterns that tend to be shorter-term—less than a year and preferably less than 26 weeks—that have a horizontal boundary.

<p>The most powerful word in the markets is “despite.” If you hear or see a comment like, “Despite the increase in oil inventories being much higher than expected, oil prices closed higher,” that is the tape telling you what is going to happen.

<p>I don’t think it’s any different now than it ever was in history. Everyone is short; the market doesn’t go down on bad news; the market starts to go up. That is what a market bottom is.

This event was one of the most defining moments for J.Crew in a decade. After that show, Michelle Obama was on the cover of almost every tabloid and fashion magazine. Immediately after that, the African American demographic completely embraced J.Crew as a brand. (loc 3965)</p>

<p>When Netflix released Stranger Things, everyone knew it was a hit show—that by itself wasn’t any real information. Also, a hit show on Netflix doesn’t mean anything because they have hit shows with some regularity. The real question was whether Stranger Things was an anomaly. I measured the volume of people speaking the words Stranger Things, and then I compared it with the top five shows they had produced in the prior five years. (loc 3951)</p>

<p>For the long mean-reversion system, the underlying requirement was that the stock had to be in an uptrend because you don’t want to buy a stock that keeps going down and down. Then the following condition was that the stock had to be down a certain percentage from its recent high within a given time frame. If these two conditions were met, then I would enter a buy order a specified amount lower, with the exact amount lower based on the stock’s average daily volatility. (loc 4536)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A wonderful mix of philosophy, theory, and practicality – Sinclair&#39;s textbook is a must-read for anyone embarking on a career related to volatility. Unlike typical finance textbooks that spend pages dazzling you with maths of dubious practicality, Sinclair cuts through the fluff to hit the most important topics, while linking to relevant academic research in the footnotes.</p>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Philosophy: modelling entails transformation to a slower-moving (i.e more understandable) parameter space</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Theory: the technicals of removing bias from rolling (overlapping) windows when calculating volatility</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Practicality: hard to choose just one here. Liked the chapters on bet sizing (particularly the effects of parameter misestimation on Kelly betting), the explainers of VIX/ETNs, etc. But the <em>Life Cycle of a Trade</em> is gold – very hard to get that kind of insight outside of an actual desk!</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Piranesi</em> is a quirky little novel. It starts off as a gorgeous work of magical realism before morphing into a pleasant, if somewhat benign, mystery thriller.</p>
<p>It’s not Tolstoy. The development of the plot is poorly managed at times, with plot twists revealed to the reader several pages before the character realises what’s happening. The reliance on diaries for exposition gets a little dull.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think <em>Piranesi</em> is suitable for a diverse audience (including people with no exposure to magical realism) – Murakami with a dash of Lovecraft. Perfect for a long weekend.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Successful traders have the same underlying mental model]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is <em>the</em> book I wish I had read before starting out in the hedge fund industry. It is a realistic and up-to-date account of what works, from the perspective of a guy who has run billions of dollars — not so much the actual strategies (though there are a few hints), but more so the philosophy required to succeed in the HF space.</p>
<p><em>The Front Office</em> covers a lot of ground. Everything from the philosophy of markets outlined above, to the practicalities of raising capital, to technical descriptions of market microstructure. This is all excellent stuff that is seldom discussed in print.</p>
<p>However, the parts that I found most valuable were those discussing the psychology required to &quot;make it&quot;. Genius is table stakes in the HF industry; mastery of one&#39;s psychology is the differentiator. Rather than a rehashing of the cognitive biases you may find in <a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>, Costello takes a much more epistemological angle, describing Aquinas&#39; two paths to Truth — revelation and reason — and their link with emotion. A revelatory truth is one that &quot;pops into your head&quot;, whereas rational truths are those that derive from careful induction based on facts (obviously the latter are better in hedge funds). Costello suggests an easy way of distinguishing between the two: observe if someone&#39;s disagreement with your &quot;truth&quot; makes you at all angry — to the extent it does, your truth is revelatory. If you&#39;re tall and someone calls you short, you don&#39;t get angry (though perhaps irritated at their obstinance). This simple test has helped me catch my own rationalising (even if I think I&#39;m not rationalising).</p>
<p>Overall, <em>The Front Office</em> is a wonderfully balanced take. Costello emphasises the supreme importance of honesty and credibility (&quot;being seen as ignorant is infinitely better than dishonest&quot;) while highlighting the competitive reality that you need to exploit the mistakes of other market participants.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself, but an area on which I need to reflect more is stress management. Costello believes it is something you are either born with or not, so I guess I&#39;ll find out one day.</p>

<h3>Key points</h3>
<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The most successful people have different approaches, but almost all have the same mental model of how markets work:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Markets are a deterministic information-processing machine. The goal of a hedgie is to model how new information affects investor behaviour.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">&quot;Spot the difference&quot;: we are looking for similar assets with different return streams.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Opportunities come from knowledge gaps or incentive mismatches — systems where market participants are trading on less information (or with less intelligence), or trading with a goal other than profit-maximisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Technical points:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">everything in finance can be modelled as a swap - not just contracts, but also organisational decisions etc.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">fundamental tradeoff between short-term models (need high freq and high hit rate to make up for lower volume) and long-term models (higher capacity but more PnL volatility).</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Liquidity is one of the most important drivers of big swings. Yet nobody has a good definition of it, let alone a predictive model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The hedge fund industry is viciously competitive. Mistakes get exploited by other market participants. The industry is highly optimised for making money. This can actually be a good thing, leading to flat hierarchies and a relative lack of office politics.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">The number 1 prerequisite for success (when raising capital from institutions) is credibility. This requires having a track record, a deep understanding of the mispricing you are trying to capture, and the perception that you are honest - &quot;being seen as ignorant is infinitely better than dishonest&quot;.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Genius is table stakes. Psychology is the differentiator:<ul class="!my-2 !pl-5">
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">if you&#39;re tall and someone calls you short, you probably don&#39;t get angry. If you get angry <em>at all</em> when someone disagrees with you, there is some aspect in which your claim is a &quot;revelatory&quot; truth - i.e one that you have generated internally, rather than a purely empirical chain of deductions.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">It is incredibly difficult to have a complexion that allows you to put billions of dollars on the line. Don&#39;t underestimate the stress.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">&quot;You have to be able to live with the fact that every single day that you walk into the office, it may very well be your last. Ever. There is success, and there is oblivion. There is no backup.&quot;</li>

<p>the return profile of the hedge fund industry is a Pareto distribution, and something close to 80% of that 224 Billion in yearly profits came from the largest 20% of hedge funds, (loc 11)</p>
<p><em>Anecdotally, this inequality is growing over time.</em></p>

<p>Imagine a much smarter version of Robert Duvall in the “Apocalypse Now” beach scene with mortars going off all around him, while calmly discussing the break of the waves using computational fluid dynamics that he’s calculated in his head. Imagine him scratching out the differential math in the beach sand. That’s a better analogy for the actual day to day in the hedge fund world. (loc 116)</p>

<p>The hedge fund industry is entirely too competitive for a company to be managed with any top down corporate values. Only the high margin monopolies of Silicon Valley can afford things like that. (loc 482)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Enter the hedge fund. The industry actually gets its name not because of the manner in which they manage their investments, but the role they play as investments in the portfolios of their largest investors. (loc 1169)</p>

<p>There are rules, and the rules are adhered to 99.5% of the time, which is probably better than most industries. But it’s an intensely competitive domain where every opportunity must be exploited and where profit comes almost exclusively from exploiting other people’s mistakes. If you want to survive in the jungle, your claws should be just as sharp as the next guy. (loc 2324)</p>

<p>There’s a saying that an Investment Banking friend of mine repeats all the time. A’s hire B’s and B’s hire C’s and D’s. It may work that way in the rest of the commercial world.

<p>In summary to get a position like that, you’ll need a trading strategy with a higher than average return compared to others in your space, peak drawdown below 20%, a low correlation to your market, a Sharpe ratio above the specific metric set by your employer (usually somewhere between 1 and 2), and there will be restrictions on the assets you can trade and the manner in which you can trade them, all designed to make sure you are as uncorrelated as possible to the other strategies they’re already trading which compete with yours. This is all typically negotiated at hiring time. (loc 303)</p>

<p>if you are looking for the maximum possible level of credibility whatever your level of knowledge, and want your trading idea to be fully and immediately accepted by investors, or the banks and top tier of hedge funds, the way you describe it should always start with a mistake <em>[being made by other market participants]</em> (loc 1110)</p>

<p>Even if you’re meeting their expectations and are offered a job, you’ll make less money at someone else’s firm than you will by forming your own. They’ve gone to the trouble of building an efficient back office, and will want to be compensated by you, for saving you the trouble. (loc 309)</p>

<p>You might charge wealthy individual investors something close to that, but institutions who control the big money will have no interest in you at those rates. Offer them a deal for zero and 30 and they’ll be much more receptive. The industry is only too happy to pay big for upside, so ditching the two percent “management fee” is usually better received. If it were me, I’d start at 1 &amp; 20 and make them ask for a better deal. (loc 333)</p>

<p>Some of those blind monks will tell you that the market is about understanding animal spirits. Others will tell you the benefits of sector rotation, or value investing, or the technical shape of some chart. Some will insist it’s all about balance sheet assessment or economic analysis. All of those things are perfectly valid parts of the market, but none of them describes the whole thing.

<p>To institutions, any time you can borrow at one rate, say 1%, and lend at another of say 1.1%, with all other things being equal, they’ll borrow as much as they can, increasing their leverage in the process, and keep the .1%.

<p>after a few weeks the market makers had figured out their game. When these kids (and I do mean kids, some were 17 year olds lying about their age) would use massive options leverage to create a liquidity shortage in the stocks, the market makers would simply fail to rise to the bait. Instead of responding to it by letting the price rise as they normally would, the market makers would make up the liquidity difference themselves by taking on additional risk and keeping prices right where they were. They knew the kids were highly levered so time was working against them. All they had to do was hold prices in the normal range for a single day, when mark to market accounting would force the kids to sell out of their highly levered positions to avoid margin calls, whatever the price was.

<p>every successful trading model is caught between a rock and a hard place. In a short-term model, your position sizes are small because of limited trading volume, so you need a lot of trading and a pretty high hit rate to get a lot of P&amp;L. In a longer-term model, there is plenty of volume available for you. But you need a very effective hedge to mitigate the volatility you import into your positions with the larger trade size, and maybe an outside the box trade execution strategy to acquire it effectively. There is simply no way to avoid that. There is no innovative vision that lets you ignore those rules. (loc 3435)</p>

<p>For inspirational truth, the process then stops. You have the truth and you have evidence. No further consideration is necessary. If there is easy evidence to contradict your view, it can probably be explained away. There is no reason to look for any counter-factual. On the contrary if anyone else presents one, it will seem distasteful or disloyal to you in some way. From the moment you embrace it, your confidence in this truth is defined by your belief in it. On the opposing side of this 13th century debate was Aquinas’s reason. “Truth” said Aquinas, “can be found by observing the world around you.” You look at the myriad of categories and contradictions in the world and try to derive rules explicitly from that information which seem to illuminate some aspect of the phenomena you see around you.

For us, that was the very real sword of Damocles that hung over all our heads, for as long as we did our jobs. (loc 2531)</div></details></p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economists have physics envy; they should instead turn to ecology]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Adaptive Markets</em> is <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em> meets <a href="/?books=thinking-fast-and-slow" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> (with a healthy splash of <em>The Selfish Gene</em> ).</p>
<p>Andrew Lo gives a fantastic overview of the origins of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the difficulties of convincing academic finance that it is incorrect. However, I like that he doesn&#39;t go as far as completely discounting the value of the EMH – it is an incredible first approximation, and unlike so many other competing philosophies, it actually makes testable predictions (even if they turn out not to be correct).</p>
<p>A central theme in the book is that &quot;it takes a theory to beat a theory&quot; – the library of cognitive biases explored by Kahneman and Tversky does not quite meet this standard (even when unified under Prospect Theory). Lo argues that a prevailing issue is the modern economist&#39;s &quot;box of tools&quot; – post Samuelson, economists became closet wannabes of mathematical physicists. But it could just be that mathematical physics is fundamentally the wrong language to describe a complex system in which the fundamental unit does not obey deterministic rules – there&#39;s that famous Feynman quote about how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.</p>
<p>Lo instead proposes that the answer lies in evolutionary biology, which explains the <em>origins</em> of our biases, combined with the science of ecosystems which explains the complex feedback loops that process our individual behaviours into macroscopic properties. One of the highlights of the book is when Lo shows that this new theory is able to explain a particularly weird cognitive bias called probability matching.</p>
<p>The book is really a 5-star read, except for one deep criticism. It seems to me that Lo has slightly lower standards for his theory of Adaptive Markets than he does for the alternatives. In particular, my fear is that the Adaptive Markets hypothesis is one of those blanket theories that can predict anything under the sun – i.e it is not falsifiable in Popper&#39;s sense (though strangely, Lo uses that to criticise other theories). With the evolutionary simulations, for example, it is very clear that the parameters (which the researchers input) completely determine the outcome, and Lo neglects to discuss the difficult task of calibrating these agent-based models. I would have liked to see a slightly more self-critical approach to his own theory.</p>
<p>But this aside, <em>Adaptive Markets</em> is a refreshingly modern take on traditional finance and ends on a surprisingly optimistic note. After all, in nature, evolution has created wonderful diversity, efficiency, and beauty –why can&#39;t the same be true for financial markets?</p>

<p>We need a better theory. Markets do look efficient under certain circumstances, namely, when investors have had a chance to adapt to existing business conditions, and those conditions remain relatively stable over a long enough period of time. If the previous sentence sounds like the fine print of an insurance policy, it should; business conditions often shift violently and “long enough” depends on a lot of things.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>our rationality is biologically too limited for the Efficient Markets Hypothesis to hold at all times and in every possible context.</p>

<p>this might involve a sixth-order theory of mind? While arbitrage and the profit motive can exploit a misjudgment, they still rely on the ability of investors to recognize when a mistake has taken place. In many cases, this expectation is simply unrealistic. The history of markets is filled with “rational” investors going wrong with utter confidence in the soundness of their judgment—until brought down by information just beyond their range of consideration or understanding.</p>

<p>Neuroscience and evolutionary biology confirm that rational expectations and the Efficient Markets Hypothesis capture only a portion of the full range of human behavior. That portion isn’t small or unimportant—it provides an excellent first approximation of many financial markets and circumstances, and should never be ignored—but it’s still incomplete. Market behavior, like all human behavior, is the outcome of eons of evolutionary forces.</p>

<p>although our sessions might appear to be scholarly and cordial, with about as much conflict and debate as a silent meditation retreat, beneath this veneer of academic civility rage passions that only insiders can fully appreciate. Insecurity, jealousy, pugnacity, audacity, exhibitionism, narcissism, and vengeance all figure prominently in the typical academic’s psychological profile.</p>

<p>Our ability to choose an optimal behavior appears related to our ability to come up with the most plausible sounding explanation of the world: the best narrative. It turns out that we may have Homo economicus in our brains after all—acting as a literary critic.</p>

<p>Rosenthal continued his research into this subtle bias, which he dubbed “the Pygmalion effect,” after the well-known Greek myth about the sculptor who fell in love with a statue of his own creation. Researchers found evidence for the Pygmalion effect in management, in the court system, in the long-term care of the elderly, and over and over again, in schools. If teachers had positive expectations for a student, that student would tend to do better than students without good expectations, and if teachers had negative expectations for a student, that student would tend to do more poorly.</p>

<p>Traders who described more intense reactions to both losing and making money performed significantly worse than others. In addition, those who scored higher on a measure of “internality”—the tendency to ascribe the causes of various events in their lives to their own doing versus random chance—also performed much worse than those who scored lower on this scale. These patterns tell us something about the stuff good traders are made of: more controlled emotional responses, including the ability to refrain from blaming</p>

<p>When individuals make decisions, we calculate toward the best solution until we reach a breakeven point, where any additional benefits from the calculation are balanced by the cost of getting there. Simon coined the term satisficing (a mix of “satisfy” and “suffice”) to refer to this behavior. Individuals didn’t optimize—they satisficed, making decisions that weren’t always optimal, but were good enough. Simon called this theory bounded rationality.</p>

<p>Without the amygdala and the sense of fear, human beings aren’t able to judge risks rationally. Being without fear is, in a very real sense, deeply irrational.</p>

<p>Like Dr. Pangloss of Voltaire’s satire Candide, who never tires of reminding his pupil that “all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,” evolutionists are accused of arguing that an animal’s adaptations are always optimal for its local environment, in an ecosystem that’s the most efficient of all possible ecosystems.</p>

<p>By comparing the performance of pairs of fraternal and identical twins, they found that a third of the observed investment behavior in the Swedish twin portfolios could be attributed to genetics: 29 percent of stock market participation, 32 percent of the share of equities, and 38 percent of portfolio volatility.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the basic idea [of the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis] can be summarized in just five key principles:</p>
<ol>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">We are neither always rational nor irrational, but we are biological entities whose features and behaviors are shaped by the forces of evolution.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">We display behavioral biases and make apparently suboptimal decisions, but we can learn from past experience and revise our heuristics in response to negative feedback.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">We have the capacity for abstract thinking, specifically forward-looking what-if analysis; predictions about the future based on past experience; and preparation for changes in our environment. This is evolution at the speed of thought, which is different from but related to biological evolution.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Financial market dynamics are driven by our interactions as we behave, learn, and adapt to each other, and to the social, cultural, political, economic, and natural environments in which we live.</li>
<li class="!my-1 !leading-normal">Survival is the ultimate force driving competition, innovation, and adaptation. These too, will look “irrational.” But the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis refuses to label such behaviors “irrational.” It recognizes that suboptimal behavior is going to happen when we take heuristics out of the environmental context in which they emerged, like the great white shark on the beach. Even when an economic behavior appears extremely irrational, like the rogue trader doubling down in order to recoup irrecoverable losses, it may still have an adaptive explanation. To borrow a word from evolutionary biology, a more accurate description for such behavior isn’t “irrational,” but “maladaptive.”</li>
</ol>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If these examples are giving you the feeling that the behavior selected by evolution depends critically on the environment, you’re beginning to understand the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. “It’s the environment, stupid!” applies to behavior as well as to species. Herbert Simon once said, “An ant, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent complexity of its behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which it finds itself.”</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>When a population of individuals faces common risks, there has to be a certain degree of diversity in their individual behaviors. If they all behaved in the same way, and that common behavior just happened to be the wrong behavior for a given environmental outcome, for instance, nesting in the valley when it rains, the entire population suffers the consequences. But when there are no common risks, the entire population can behave in exactly the same way, because there’s virtually no chance that all the individuals will experience a bad outcome at the same time (the one-in-a-million chance of all the independent tribbles getting rained on we described before). The difference in adaptation between systematic and idiosyncratic risk is evolutionarily tremendous, giving rise to entirely different behaviors. As we saw earlier, nature abhors an undiversified bet.</p>
<p><em>Probability matching is rational at a population level.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>We’ve seen from our excursion into neuroscience and evolutionary theory that biology is much more relevant for human behavior and bounded rationality than theories inspired by mathematical physics. In fact, most real world economic phenomena simply look more like biology than physics; it’s very rare to find any economic ideas that conform perfectly to elegant mathematical derivations.</p>

<p>the only kind of risk investors get rewarded for is systematic risk, not idiosyncratic risk. The reasoning is both simple and profound: by definition, idiosyncratic risk is unique to an individual asset, which means that if you combine a large number of assets within a single portfolio, these risks should cancel each other out.</p>

<p>The answer from the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis is that, over time, competition causes alpha to become commoditized to a level where the returns are just enough to compensate investors for the risks associated with the activity. In other words, alpha will eventually either disappear entirely, or become beta—less constrained, easy to come by, and cheap.</p>

<p>The bad news is that these losses imply a growing systemic risk in the hedge fund sector (not to be confused with systematic risk). Quantitative equity market-neutral managers were constructing very similar portfolios. Completely different secret proprietary methods had all produced portfolios with many common components because they had adapted to the same environment. This in turn reduced the effective liquidity of those components, and it was impossible for everyone to unwind their positions at once. In financial lingo, this was a “crowded trade,” a reference to the dangers of a crowded theater with too few exits.</p>

<p>The top five executives at traditional banks in the S&amp;P 500, excluding broker-dealers, were not paid vastly more than the top five executives at industrial firms in the S&amp;P 500.

<p>Many people think about morality as the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” The financial industry seems to have its own version: “Do unto others before they do unto you.” But the most recent version is from a venture capitalist friend of mine: “He who has the gold makes the rules.”</p>

<p>We can summarize the risk manager’s process with the mnemonic SIMON: Select, Identify, Measure, Optimize, and Notice. Select the significant risk factors driving portfolio returns. Identify the objective to optimize (along with any constraints). Measure the statistical laws of motion of portfolio-return dynamics. Optimize the objective to yield the optimal portfolio (subject to the return dynamics and any constraints). Notice any new change in the system, and repeat the previous steps as needed.</p>

<p>extreme redistributive socialism rarely leads to good outcomes in the long run. But pure capitalism, red in tooth and claw, won’t work either. Per capita incomes did not grow when China was “opened” by foreign gunboats, or while the East India Company controlled India. In the Congo Free State, the free market created the incentive for some of the worst atrocities in African history, leaving the center of the continent an economic wreck for generations. When we look back on the twentieth century, we shouldn’t be surprised that so many nations turned to revolutionary socialism for so long. All they wanted was their fair slice of the pie.</p>

<p>A little-known fact about the economics profession is that economists (including me) suffer from a psychological condition best described as “physics envy.” Physicists can explain 99 percent of all observable physical phenomena using Newton’s three laws of motion. Economists wish we had three laws capable of explaining 99 percent of all observable behavior in our professional purview. Instead, we probably have ninety-nine laws that explain 3 percent of all economic behavior, and it’s a source of terrible frustration for us. So we sometimes cloak our ideas in the trappings of physics. We make axioms from which we derive seemingly mathematically rigorous universal economic principles, carefully calibrated simulations, and the very occasional empirical test of those theories.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Klara and the Sun</em> is a lovely, gentle read, narrated by the quintessential Ishiguro protagonist: an observant, kind, yet passive main character who evokes sympathy from the reader due to their naïveté and suppression of emotion. It&#39;s hard to ignore the similarities between Klara and Mr Stevens from <em>The Remains of the Day</em> .</p>
<p>Despite the book&#39;s description as &quot;dystopian science fiction&quot; (the novel shares themes with <em>Never Let Me Go</em> ), I wouldn&#39;t pick up the book with that in mind. <em>Klara</em> is only sci-fi in the sense that it deals with a vaguely futuristic world. Rather, you should read <em>Klara and the Sun</em> as a neat piece of literary fiction – an introspective but delightful exploration of companionship, elitism, and soul.</p>

<p>officially, it wasn’t an issue at all – every one of us had specifications that guaranteed we couldn’t be affected by factors such as our positioning within a room. Even so, an AF would feel himself growing lethargic after a few hours away from the Sun, and start to worry there was something wrong with him – that he had some fault unique to him and that if it became known, he’d never find a home.

<p>The Mother didn’t smile often, but when she did, her smile was surprisingly like Josie’s: her whole face seemed to overflow with kindness, and the same creases that usually created such a tense expression would refold into ones of humor and gentleness. (loc 714)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At the same time, what was becoming clear to me was the extent to which humans, in their wish to escape loneliness, made maneuvers that were very complex and hard to fathom, and I saw it was possible that the consequences of Morgan’s Falls had at no stage been within my control. (loc 1588)</p>

<p>‘I think I hate Capaldi because deep down I suspect he may be right. That what he claims is true.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People are less rational than they think they are, in predictable ways. Kahneman’s classic book offers a wide variety of interesting psychological biases, thoughtfully ordered. The writing is continually engaging, and there are enough examples to ensure that his point gets across. He also intentionally makes everything useful to the reader, concluding each chapter with examples of how one might apply the ideas in day-to-day life.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve often been very cynical regarding psychology, but it is hard to dispute the <em>results</em> of the experiments and the large amount of corroborating evidence for the various biases. The existence of phenomena like risk aversion, gambling to avoid losses, and WYSIATI (what you see is all there is) seems to be beyond reasonable doubt, and it’s both humorous and scary to read a catalogued list of deficiencies in our mental models. That being said, I am still not entirely confident in the <em>explanations</em> for all of these facts. That&#39;s where psychology typically becomes pseudosciency and accordingly where I am least comfortable. But regardless of the qualms I have with psychology as a field, this book deserves its reputation as a must-read. To understand yourself, you must know the limits of your rationality.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (Dec 2021):</strong> I read this book a LONG time ago, and it is severely due for a re-read. Consequently, the highlights below are a small (and poorly chosen) sample of the valuable insights in the book – many of which have stuck with me.</p>

<p>in common language a rational person is certainly reasonable. For economists and decision theorists, the adjective has an altogether different meaning.

<p>You might think that this surprising outcome would cause much anguished soul-searching among economists, as a basic assumption of their theory had been successfully challenged. But this is not the way things work in social science, including both psychology and economics. Theoretical beliefs are robust, and it takes much more than one embarrassing finding for established theories to be seriously questioned.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is beauty in banality]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This book had been sitting quietly on my to-reads for a long time. Only recently did I work up the courage to start on a &quot;classic&quot; fiction novel and I&#39;m so glad I did.</p>
<p><em>Stoner</em> is a simple read, but an emotionally painful one. It is a story of loneliness, loss, and failure – but not the dramatic kind of failure after which the protagonist heroically rebounds and gets the girl – more of a gradual, numbing series of small missteps that lead to lost opportunities and unfulfilled potential. It is water torture rather than Greek tragedy: the few things that bring William Stoner joy are slowly whittled down by forces outside of his control. Stoner&#39;s hamartia is that ordinariness is a deep part of identity; in one of the saddest scenes of the book, Stoner realises that he cannot give up his ordinary life to continue his affair with Katherine because to do so would be to fundamentally change his identity.</p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting to contrast this novel with other classic American fiction, particularly F Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s work. Stoner&#39;s wife reminds me of some of Fitzgerald’s female characters, or to a lesser extent, Blanche from <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> . The New Yorker has a nice take, describing <em>Stoner</em> as an antiparticle of <em>The</em> <em>Great Gatsby</em> : William Stoner is plain where Jay Gatsby is glamorous, unassuming rather than affable, yet he shares many of the same difficulties that Gatsby does.</p>
<p>There are brief undercurrents of hope – indeed, John Williams thought that Stoner had a good life. On his death bed, Stoner draws a gentle comfort from the book he had written many years before: &quot;It hardly mattered to him that the book was forgotten and served no use; and the question of its worth at any time seemed almost trivial&quot;. The message I draw from Stoner is a diluted version of Camus&#39; absurdist philosophy. From <a href="/?books=the-myth-of-sisyphus" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Myth of Sisyphus</a>):</p>
<p>There is beauty in banality; even a quiet life with much &quot;wasted&quot; potential is a story worth telling. One must imagine William Stoner happy indeed.</p>
<p>**EDIT (Jan 2022): **<em>Stoner</em> has a pretty similar vibe to the classic British sitcom *Peep Show* , minus the situational comedy, with an extra helping of the constant disappointment.</p>

<p>Sometimes he thought of himself as he had been a few years before and was astonished by the memory of that strange figure (loc 329)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He suspected that he was beginning, ten years late, to discover who he was; and the figure he saw was both more and less than he had once imagined it to be. (loc 1624)</p>

<p>Thus he found it possible to live, and even to be happy, now and then. The interim chairmanship of the English Department, which Gordon Finch had assumed after the death of Archer Sloane, was renewed year after year, until all the members of the department grew used to a casual anarchy in which somehow classes got scheduled and taught, in which new appointments to the staff were made, in which the trivial departmental details somehow got taken care of, and in which year somehow succeeded year. (loc 1823)</p>

<p>He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. (loc 2524)</p>

<p>William Stoner knew of the world in a way that few of his younger colleagues could understand. Deep in him, beneath his memory, was the knowledge of hardship and hunger and endurance and pain. (loc 3069)</p>

<p>Stoner&#39;s colleagues, who held him in no particular esteem when he was alive, speak of him rarely now; to the older ones, his name is a reminder of the end that awaits them all, and to the younger ones it is merely a sound which evokes no sense of the past and no identity with which they can associate themselves or their careers.

<p>&quot;Nor do you escape, my friend. No indeed. Who are you? A simple son of the soil, as you pretend to yourself? Oh, no. You, too, are among the infirm--you are the dreamer, the madman in a madder world, our own midwestern Don Quixote without his Sancho, gamboling under the blue sky. You&#39;re bright enough--brighter anyhow than our mutual friend. But you have the taint, the old infirmity. You think there&#39;s something here, something to find. Well, in the world you&#39;d learn soon enough. You, too, are cut out for failure; not that you&#39;d fight the world. You&#39;d let it chew you up and spit you out, and you&#39;d lie there wondering what was wrong. Because you&#39;d always expect the world to be something it wasn&#39;t, something it had no wish to be. (loc 519)</p>

<p>he had been unable to discover for her any meaning in their life together, in their marriage. Thus it was right for her to take what meaning she could find in areas that had nothing to do with him and go ways he could not follow. (loc 1697)</p>

<p>He did not allow himself the easy luxury of guilt; given his own nature and the circumstance of his life with Edith, there was nothing that he could have done. And that knowledge intensified his sadness as no guilt could have, and made his love for his daughter more searching and more deep. (loc 3295)</p>

<p>Stoner came to realize that she was, as she had said, almost happy with her despair; she would live her days out quietly, drinking a little more, year by year, numbing herself against the nothingness her life had become. He was glad she had that, at least; he was grateful that she could drink. (loc 3471)</p>

<p>His parents were happy to see him, and they seemed not to resent his decision. But he found that he had nothing to say to them; already, he realized, he and his parents were becoming strangers; and he felt his love increased by its loss. He returned to Columbia a week earlier than he had intended. (loc 449)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Her parents behaved toward each other with a distant courtesy; Edith never saw pass between them the spontaneous warmth of either anger or love. Anger was days of courteous silence, and love was a word of courteous endearment. She was an only child, and loneliness was one of the earliest conditions of her life. (loc 845)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>He felt a distant closeness to her, and a pity for her helplessness; desire thickened in his throat so that he could not speak. He pulled her a little toward the bedroom, feeling a quick hard resistance in her body, and feeling at the same moment a willed putting away of the resistance. (loc 1063)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Very soon Stoner realized that the force which drew their bodies together had little to do with love; they coupled with a fierce yet detached determination, drew apart, and coupled again, without the strength to surfeit their need. (loc 1254)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart. (loc 2736)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>It was an unspoken knowledge they both had, that the possibilities they imagined and elaborated were gestures of love and a celebration of the life they had together now. (loc 2773)</p>

<p>Sometimes they would lift their eyes from their studies, smile at each other, and return to their reading; sometimes Stoner would look up from his book and let his gaze rest upon the graceful curve of Katherine&#39;s back and upon the slender neck where a tendril of hair always fell. Then a slow, easy desire would come over him like a calm, and he would rise and stand behind her and let his arms rest lightly on her shoulders. She would straighten and let her head go back against his chest, and his hands would go forward into the loose robe and gently touch her breasts. Then they would make love, and lie quietly for a while, and return to their studies, as if their love and learning were one process. (loc 2783)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>&quot;Because in the long run,&quot; Stoner said, &quot;it isn&#39;t Edith or even Grace, or the certainty of losing Grace, that keeps me here; it isn&#39;t the scandal or the hurt to you or me; it isn&#39;t the hardship we would have to go through, or even the loss of love we might have to face. It&#39;s simply the destruction of ourselves, of what we do.&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; Katherine said. &quot;So we are of the world, after all; we should have known that. We did know it, I believe; but we had to withdraw a little, pretend a little, so that we could--&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; Katherine said. &quot;I&#39;ve known it all along, I guess. Even with the pretending, I&#39;ve known that sometime, sometime, we would . . . I&#39;ve known.&quot; (loc 3021)</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> presents Camus&#39; philosophy of Absurdism, which is so pervasive in his other works. It took a while before I could appreciate what Camus meant by Absurd – it is the fundamental contradiction of our search for meaning in a profoundly indifferent universe.</p>
<p>Suicide is a possible solution for this – as Camus says, it is the &quot;one truly serious philosophical problem&quot;. Yet Camus rejects suicide. Rather, the absurdist individual recognises the immense value of continuing on in spite of the meaninglessness of life (&quot;one must imagine Sisyphus happy&quot;) and perhaps even drawing meaning from the struggle.</p>
<p>Although the essay isn&#39;t terribly long, it is by no means easy to get through. Camus’ rich verbiage combined with his thoughtful arguments (and erudite references to works of other philosophers and authors) makes this a difficult and sombre read. But putting in the effort has deepened my appreciation of his other works, especially <a href="/?books=the-stranger" class="text-[#5C14A4] dark:text-[#9747FF] hover:underline font-medium italic">The Stranger</a>, which I think is the perfect fictional companion to <em>The Myth.</em></p>

<p>An act like this is prepared within the silence of the heart, as is a great work of art. The man himself is ignorant of it.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I am not interested in philosophical suicide, but rather in plain suicide. I merely wish to purge it of its emotional content and know its logic and its integrity.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>If I judge that a thing is true, I must preserve it. If I attempt to solve a problem, at least I must not by that very solution conjure away one of the terms of the problem. For me the sole datum is the absurd. The first and, after all, the only condition of my inquiry is to preserve the very thing that crushes me, consequently to respect what I consider essential in it. I have just defined it as a confrontation and an unceasing struggle.</p>
<p><em>I&#39;ve spent a long time on this passage. I think Camus is saying that while a solution can solve a problem (by definition), it must not remove the philosophical existence of the problem. Thus the human struggle against the indifference of the universe must be, in its own way, preserved and valued. He rejects suicide as a viable option.</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>For if there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>“Oh, to be nothing!” For thousands of years this great cry has roused millions of men to revolt against desire and pain. Its dying echoes have reached this far, across centuries and oceans, to the oldest sea in the world.</p>

<p>For the absurd man it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing. Everything begins with lucid indifference.</p>
<p><em>“Lucid indifference” – what a phrase!</em></p>

<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The work of art is born of the intelligence’s refusal to reason the concrete. It marks the triumph of the carnal. It is lucid thought that provokes it, but in that very act that thought repudiates itself.</p>

<p>Performing these two tasks simultaneously, negating on the one hand and magnifying on the other, is the way open to the absurd creator. He must give the void its colors.</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse and nothingness. He can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation.</p>

<p>This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is quite absurd, and death’s the final word]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was almost three years to this date when I last read <em>The Stranger</em> (to impress a school teacher). I&#39;d like to say my literary tastes have become slightly more refined, but even so, this book remains one of my favourites.</p>
<p>It&#39;s difficult to characterise Mersault succinctly. He is certainly not a defeatist; he will help others if he has no reason not to. Apathy would seem to be a more appropriate descriptor, but I don&#39;t think that does his character full justice. In any case, I think &#39;indifferent&#39; is a better way of describing Mersault. It is not so much that he does not care, rather that he has no opinion on certain things. He is a rational man who is condemned for not playing the societal game.</p>
<p>The subtlety with which Camus builds the character of Mersault is something that I missed the first time reading it. Mersault experiences time pass in a very unusual way; he can lose whole days observing the movements of people on his street and doesn&#39;t seem to dwell on anything but the present. The motif of the heat is another thing that I didn&#39;t give due attention to. The Algerian heat radiates from the pages – you can almost feel yourself sweating along with Mersault and the other overdressed gentlemen. This sickening heat comes into play throughout the novel and in some sense precipitates the main events in the book. It&#39;s more powerful than the basic pathetic fallacy: it&#39;s a powerful image of the incomprehensible indifference of the universe: it is described as being &#39;&quot;inhuman and oppressive&quot;, and seems to dictate the behaviours of the characters. It is this universal indifference that Mersault finally understands in the last stage of the book, reaching a catharsis of sorts as he manages to make his view of the universe self-consistent.</p>
<hr>
<p>MOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>with my spirit lamp and some bits of bread beside it. It occurred to me that somehow I’d got through another Sunday, that Mother now was buried, and tomorrow I’d be going back to work as usual. Really, nothing in my life had changed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When she laughed I wanted her again. A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort of question had no meaning, really; but I supposed I didn’t.</p>
<p><em>King</em> 👑</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And just then it crossed my mind that one might fire, or not fire—and it would come to absolutely the same thing.</p>
<p><em>Mersault’s struggles with morality in an amoral – not immoral – universe.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I’ve often thought that had I been compelled to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but gaze up at the patch of sky just overhead, I’d have got used to it by degrees.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“I accuse the prisoner of behaving at his mother’s funeral in a way that showed he was already a criminal at heart.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>They always came for one at dawn; that much I knew. So, really, all my nights were spent in waiting for that dawn. I have never liked being taken by surprise.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the years that were to come. And on its way that breeze had leveled out all the ideas that people tried to foist on me in the equally unreal years I then was living through. What difference could they make to me, the deaths of others, or a mother’s love, or his God; or the way a man decides to live, the fate he thinks he chooses, since one and the same fate was bound to “choose” not only me but thousands of millions of privileged people who, like him, called themselves my brothers.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murakami’s life as an author, through the lens of running]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em> is a different kind of memoir: Murakami takes us through his life and writing through the lens of running. As he recounts, his running style is similar to his style as an author. Or perhaps it would be more precise to say that he writes for the same reason he runs. Running does not need to be a competitive activity and neither does writing – if one looks at it the right way, one may delight in the simplicity of &quot;mind over matter&quot; (or I suppose &quot;mind over mind&quot; in the case of writing).</p>
<p>Murakami presents writing as an endurance sport, frequently attributing his success to work ethic rather than talent (though it is hard for a reader to know how much of this is humility vs reality).</p>
<p>There is a somewhat melancholy undercurrent about the inevitability of ageing: an acceptance that at some point your abilities (be they physical or intellectual) enter a steady decline. Murakami acknowledges that his best running years are behind him; I have to wonder whether he feels the same way about his writing.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t read this looking for deep meaning. It&#39;s not that kind of book. It is instead a reflective and down-to-earth biography – a gentle read, written with Murakami&#39;s signature plain style (which, reading over this review, I seem to have adopted).</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<details class="mt-0 mb-2"><summary class="py-0 px-2 cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 font-medium"><strong>Endurance</strong></summary><div class="pl-6 -mt-3">
<p>Somerset Maugham once wrote that in each shave lies a philosophy. I couldn’t agree more. No matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative, even meditative act. (loc 25)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. (loc 35)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it, but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run, the point being to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day. This is the same sort of tack I find necessary when writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day’s work goes surprisingly smoothly. (loc 66)</p>
<p><em>A useful trick to avoiding burnout?</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>To tell the truth, I don’t even think there’s that much correlation between my running every day and whether or not I have a strong will. I think I’ve been able to run for more than twenty years for a simple reason: It suits me. Or at least because I don’t find it all that painful. (loc 480)</p>
<p><em>I like this – we shouldn’t over-romanticise our chosen activities/profession. It could just be that it suits us</em></p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>Most of what I know about writing I’ve learned through running every day. These are practical, physical lessons. How much can I push myself? (loc 872)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>All the parts of my body had their chance to take center stage and scream out their complaints. They screamed, complained, yelled in distress, and warned me that they weren’t going to take it anymore. For them, running sixty miles was an unknown experience, and each body part had its own excuse. (loc 1162)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>My time, the rank I attain, my outward appearance—all of these are secondary. For a runner like me, what’s really important is reaching the goal I set myself, under my own power. I give it everything I have, endure what needs enduring, and am able, in my own way, to be satisfied. (loc 1821)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div></div></details>

<p>Most ordinary runners are motivated by an individual goal, more than anything: namely, a time they want to beat. (loc 119)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>the thought struck me: You know what? I could try writing a novel. I still can remember the wide open sky, the feel of the new grass, the satisfying crack of the bat. Something flew down from the sky at that instant, and whatever it was, I accepted it. (loc 304)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>I never had any ambitions to be a novelist. I just had this strong desire to write a novel. (loc 306)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>There’s no need to be literature’s top runner. I went on writing the kind of things I wanted to write, exactly the way I wanted to write them, and if that allowed me to make a normal living, then I couldn’t ask for more. (loc 425)</p>

<p>Writers who are blessed with inborn talent can freely write novels no matter what they do—or don’t do. Like water from a natural spring, the sentences just well up, and with little or no effort these writers can complete a work. Occasionally you’ll find someone like that, but, unfortunately, that category wouldn’t include me. I haven’t spotted any springs nearby. I have to pound the rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of creativity. To write a novel I have to drive myself hard physically and use a lot of time and effort. (loc 468)</p>
<div class="flex items-center justify-center my-1"><span class="inline-flex items-center text-muted-foreground text-sm tracking-widest">&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</span></div>

<p>The remaining majority of writers who can’t reach such heights (including me, of course) have to supplement what’s missing from their store of talent through whatever means they can. Otherwise it’s impossible for them to keep on writing novels of any value. (loc 869)</p>

<p>When the body disintegrates, the spirit also (most likely) is gone too. I’m well aware of that. However, I’d like to postpone, for as long as I possibly can, the point where my vitality is defeated and surpassed by the toxin. (loc 1060)</p>

<p>I’m not a young person who’s focused totally on breaking records, nor an inorganic machine that goes through the motions. I’m nothing more or less than a (most likely honest) professional writer who knows his limits, who wants to hold on to his abilities and vitality for as long as possible. (loc 1293)</p>

<p>writing novels is an unhealthy type of work. When we set off to write a novel, when we use writing to create a story, like it or not a kind of toxin that lies deep down in all humanity rises to the surface. All writers have to come face-to-face with this toxin and, aware of the danger involved, discover a way to deal with it, because otherwise no creative activity in the real sense can take place.
